      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em><br>This plum-sized, nearly spherical sandstone is imbued with a touch of air magic. Typically, 1d4 + 4 air seeds are found together.<br>You can use an action to throw the seed up to 60 feet. The seed explodes on impact and is destroyed. When it explodes, the seed releases a burst of fresh, breathable air, and it disperses gas or vapor and extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames within a 10-foot radius of where the seed landed. Each suffocating or choking creature within a 10-foot radius of where the seed landed gains a lung full of air, allowing the creature to hold its breath for 5 minutes. If you break the seed while underwater, each creature within a 10-foot radius of where you broke the seed gains a lung full of air, allowing the creature to hold its breath for 5 minutes.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
