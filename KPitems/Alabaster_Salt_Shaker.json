      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>This shaker is carved from purest alabaster in the shape of an owl. It is 7 inches tall and contains enough salt to flavor 25 meals. When the shaker is empty, it can’t be refilled, and it becomes nonmagical. When you or another creature eat a meal salted by this shaker, you don’t need to eat again for 48 hours, at which point the magic wears off. If you don’t eat within 1 hour of the magic wearing off, you gain one level of exhaustion. You continue gaining one level of exhaustion for each additional hour you don’t eat.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
