      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>When you finish a long rest while wearing this amulet, you can choose one cantrip from the cleric spell list. You can cast that cantrip from the amulet at will, using Wisdom as your spellcasting ability for it.<br><em><strong>Change Fate.</strong></em> When you fail an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw while wearing the amulet, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br><em><strong>Eternal Gift.</strong></em> The amulet can’t be taken from you against your will. If you want to part with the amulet, you must donate it willingly. If you exchange the amulet for money or some other good or service, you have disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws until the next dawn, at which time the amulet reappears on your person. At the GM’s discretion, the amulet can be exchanged in return for a service such as saving a life, rebuilding a burned home, or other selfless service.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
