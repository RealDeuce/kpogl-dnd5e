      "value": "<p><em>Armor (chain mail), rare (requires attunement)</em><br>While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can use an action to cause parts of the armor to unravel into long, animated chains. While the chains are active, you have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and your AC is reduced by 2. You can use a bonus action to deactivate the chains, returning the armor to normal.<br><em><strong>Grasping Chains.</strong></em> While wearing this armor with the chains active, you can use an action to attack twice with the chains. You are proficient with the chains. Each chain has a reach of 10 feet and deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you hit a creature of your size or smaller using a chain, you automatically grapple the creature with the chain. You can have no more than two creatures grappled in this way at a time. While grappling a target with a chain, you can’t attack other creatures with that chain. You can’t attack a creature with either chain if you are climbing.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
