      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>Similar to the rocks found in a bird’s gizzard, this smooth stone helps an @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.Actor.KParcanaphage000]{arcanaphage} digest magic. While you hold or wear the stone, you have advantage on saving throws against spells.<br><em><strong>Magic Absorption.</strong></em> When a spellcaster casts a spell within 30 feet of you while you are holding or wearing this stone, you can use a reaction to activate the stone and interrupt the spell. This works like the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Ek45cBpVXvJdv1Qy]{counterspell}</em> spell, except the stone must always make a check, regardless of the spell’s level. The stone makes the check with a +5 bonus. If the check is successful, the stone increases its Absorption score by 1. Its Absorption score can’t exceed 8, and if the stone has Absorption 8, it can no longer be used to interrupt spells. Once used, this property of the stone can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br><em><strong>Magic Expulsion.</strong></em> You can use an action to throw the stone up to 60 feet. The stone explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within 5 feet per Absorption score of where the stone landed must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d6 force damage per Absorption score on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
