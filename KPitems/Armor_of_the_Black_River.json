      "value": "<p><em>Armor (Heavy), Rare (Requires Attunement)</em><br>While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you are immune to shadow corruption and void taint while you wear this armor. Additionally, you can use an action to assume a ghostly form for 10 minutes (together with up to ten creatures you touch), or until you are no longer wearing the armor, gaining a flying speed of 200 feet. You cannot take actions other than movement while in this form. Once this special action is used, it canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.<br>When combined with the <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressitems.Item.KPstyxboots00000]{Styx boots}</em>, the <em>armor of the Black River</em> permits you to use any branch of the River Styx or other planar waterways as a shadow road. Once per week, you can walk on such a planar waterway for 8 hours and arrive at any other plane of your choosing.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
