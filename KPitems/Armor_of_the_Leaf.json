      "value": "<p><em>Armor (light or hide), uncommon (requires attunement by a ranger)</em><br>This suit of armor always has a forest or leaf motif and is usually green or brown in color. While wearing this armor in forest terrain, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.<br>You can use an action to transform the armor into a cloud of swirling razor-sharp leaves, and each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 slashing damage. For 1 minute, the cloud of leaves spreads out in a 10‑foot radius from you, making the area lightly obscured for creatures other than you. The cloud moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the cloud and ends the effect. While the armor is transformed, you don’t gain a base Armor Class from the armor. The armor can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
