      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (any axe), uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a creature with it, you can choose to deal no damage to the target and instead store the energy of the attack within the blade for 1 minute. You can store up to three attacks in this way.<br>When you hit a creature with this axe while you have at least one attack stored, you can release one or more stored attacks, adding the damage of those stored attacks to the damage of the current attack.<br>Each time you release one or more stored attacks from the axe, you have a 10 percent chance of causing the axe to explode. The explosion deals 2d6 force damage to you for each attack you released from the axe, and it destroys the axe.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
