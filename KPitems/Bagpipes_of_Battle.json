      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>Inspire friends and strike fear in the hearts of your enemies with the drone of valor and the shrill call of martial might!<br>You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these bagpipes. You can use an action to play them and create a fearsome and inspiring tune. Each ally within 60 feet of you that can hear the tune gains a d12 Bardic Inspiration die for 10 minutes. Each creature within 60 feet of you that can hear the tune and that is hostile to you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for 1 minute. A hostile creature has disadvantage on this saving throw if it is within 5 feet of you or your ally. A frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br>Once used, the bagpipes canâ€™t be used in this way again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
