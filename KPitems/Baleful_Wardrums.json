      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>You must be proficient with percussion instruments to use these drums. The drums have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create a baleful rumble. Each creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on its next weapon or spell attack roll. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these drums for 24 hours. The drum regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
