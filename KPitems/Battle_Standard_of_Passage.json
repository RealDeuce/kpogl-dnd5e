      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em><br>This battle standard hangs from a 4-foot-long pole and bears the colors and heraldry of a long-forgotten nation. You can use an action to plant the pole in the ground, causing the standard to whip and wave as if in a breeze. Choose up to six creatures within 30 feet of the standard, which can include yourself. Nonmagical difficult terrain costs the creatures you chose no extra movement. In addition, each creature you chose can pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.<br>The standard stops waving and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the pole from the ground. The standard canâ€™t be used this way again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
