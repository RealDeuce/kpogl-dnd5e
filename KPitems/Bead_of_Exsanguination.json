      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>This small, black bead measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weights an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 1 <em>beads of exsanguination</em> are found together. When thrown, the bead absorbs hit points from creatures near its impact site, damaging them. A bead can store up to 50 hit points at a time. When found, a bead contains 2d10 stored hit points.<br>You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. Each creature within a 20-foot radius of where the bead landed must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The bead stores hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. The bead turns from black to crimson the more hit points are stored in it.<br>If the bead absorbs 50 hit points or more, it explodes and is destroyed. Each creature within a 20â€‘foot radius of the bead when it explodes must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br>If you are holding the bead, you can use a bonus action to determine if the bead is below or above half its maximum stored hit points. If you hold and study the bead over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest, you know exactly how many hit points are stored in the bead.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
