      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>This thin cord is made from animal sinew. While wearing the cord, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to follow tracks left by beasts, giants, and humanoids. While wearing the belt, you can use a bonus action to speak the belt’s command word. If you do, you leave tracks of the animal of your choice instead of your regular tracks. These tracks can be those of a Large or smaller beast with a CR of 1 or lower, such as a pony, rabbit, or lion. If you repeat the command word, you end the effect.<br><em><strong>Beast Disguise.</strong></em> While wearing the belt and leaving beast tracks, you can speak a command word to make your physical appearance match the tracks you leave. This illusion covers you and moves with you, walking, standing, or otherwise moving as you desire. It lasts as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 10 minutes. The changes wrought by this illusion don’t hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this illusion to appear like a lion, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch the lion would pass through the larger creature’s body, feeling nothing. To discern you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
