      "value": "<p><em>Rod, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This wooden rod is topped with a ridged ball. The rod has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the rod’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the rod melts into a pool of nonmagical honey and is destroyed. Anytime you expend 1 or more charges for this rod’s properties, the ridged ball flows with delicious, nonmagical honey for 1 minute.<br><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 17): <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.l9Ju5KE7bbn3WpTm]{hold monster}</em> (5 charges) or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3Lo9boi7P2ro6QV4]{hold person}</em> (2 charges).<br><em><strong>Sticky Stick.</strong></em> While holding the rod, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and magically stick it to any surface. Until you use an action to end the effect, the rod remains stuck. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
