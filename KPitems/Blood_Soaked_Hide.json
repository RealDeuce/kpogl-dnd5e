      "value": "<p><em>Armor (hide), very rare (requires attunement)</em><br><em>Blood-soaked hide</em> armor is crafted from the tanned skins of humanoids, carefully preserved and layered. The armor is always smeared in tacky, semi-dried blood, no matter how carefully it’s cleaned. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you are immune to any effect that would cause you to lose hit points due to blood loss or ongoing wounds, such as the infernal wounds caused by a horned devil’s tail or the necrotic damage caused by a <em>sword of wounding</em>.<br><em><strong>Blood Form.</strong></em> As an action, you can transform into a flowing pool of thick blood for 1 minute, or until you use a bonus action to revert back to your true form. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying melds into your form or falls to the ground (your choice). Your statistics remain the same, but any magic items other than the blood-soaked hide cease to function. While in blood form, you can’t speak, you are resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, you can move through any opening as small as 1 inch wide without squeezing, and you can enter the space of other creatures and end your turn there.<br>A creature that starts its turn in your space must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or lose 3d6 hit points due to blood loss, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half the number of hit points the creature lost. Constructs and undead who aren’t vampires are immune to this effect.<br>Once used, you can’t use this property of the armor again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
