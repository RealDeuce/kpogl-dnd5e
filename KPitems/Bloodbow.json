      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (longbow), rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This longbow is carved of a light, sturdy wood such as hickory or yew, and it is almost always stained a deep maroon hue, lacquered and aged under layers of sundried blood. The bow is sometimes decorated with reptilian teeth, centaur tails, or other battle trophies.<br>The bow is designed to harm the particular type of creature whose blood most recently soaked the weapon. When you make a ranged attack roll with this magic weapon against a creature of that type, you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls. If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become enraged until the end of your next turn. While enraged, the target suffers a random short-term madness.<br><em>Bloodbows</em> are most commonly soaked in the blood of bandits, thieves, or other humanoids. If you soak this weapon in the blood of a different type of creature for at least 1 hour, it ceases to affect the previous type of creature. The bow affects the new type of creature after you finish a long rest.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
