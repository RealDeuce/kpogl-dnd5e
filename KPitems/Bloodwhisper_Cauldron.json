      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a creature of evil alignment)</em><br>This ancient, oxidized cauldron sits on three stubby legs and has images of sacrifice and ritual cast into its iron sides. When filled with concoctions that contain blood, the bubbling cauldron seems to whisper secrets of ancient power to those bold enough to listen. While filled with blood, the cauldron has the following properties. Once filled, the cauldron can’t be refilled again until the next dawn.<br><em><strong>Destruction.</strong></em> As an action, you can force the cauldron to spew a miasma of vaporous blood in a 30‑foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 4d4 necrotic damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The cauldron contains enough liquid to use this property up to 3 times before it needs to be refilled with blood.<br><em><strong>Restoration.</strong></em> As an action, you can drink from the cauldron. If you do, you regain 20 hit points, are cured of any diseases and levels of exhaustion, and you regain all expended spell slots and class features as if you had completed a long rest. Once used, this property can’t be used again for 3 days.<br><em><strong>Visions.</strong></em> If you spend at least 1 minute gazing into the bubbling liquid within the cauldron, you gain insight into your immediate future. You have advantage on the next 3 ability checks or saving throws you make within 1 hour of receiving these visions. Afterwards, the cauldron’s liquid disappears, and the cauldron must be refilled before you can use this property again.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
