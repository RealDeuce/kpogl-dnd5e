      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)</em><br>This longbow of white ash appears featureless, but once you attune to it, the symbol of your god appears burnt onto the leather grip.<br>This magic bow grants a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with the bow, the target takes an additional 1d8 radiant damage.<br>Once per day, as a bonus action while firing this bow, you can cast a spell at a target using the bow’s range instead of the spell’s normal range. You must hit with the bow for the spell to take effect, but the target has disadvantage on any saving throw it is forced to make. Even spells with a range of touch can be cast this way, though the spell must only target a single individual. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
