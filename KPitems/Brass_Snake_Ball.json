      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This heavy, brass ball is 6 inches across and weighs approximately 15 pounds. It has the image of a coiled snake embossed around it. You can use an action to command the orb to uncoil into a brass snake approximately 6 feet long and 3 inches thick. You can direct it by telepathic command to attack any creature within your line of sight. Use the statistics for the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.UTuKdTah1DKfPwWe]{constrictor snake}, but use Armor Class 14 and increase the challenge rating to 1/2 (100 XP). The snake can stay animate for up to 5 minutes or until reduced to 0 hit points. Being reduced to 0 hit points causes the snake to revert to orb form and become inert for 1 week. If damaged but not reduced to 0 hit points, the snake has full hit points when summoned again. Once you have used the orb to become a snake, it canâ€™t be used again until the next sunset.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
