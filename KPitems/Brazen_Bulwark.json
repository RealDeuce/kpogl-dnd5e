      "value": "<p><em>Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This rectangular shield is plated with polished brass and resembles a crenelated tower. While wielding this shield, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.<br><em><strong>Brazen Wall.</strong></em> As an action, you can plant the shield in the ground in front of you, transforming it into a steel wall 10 feet high, 3 inches thick, and up to 20 feet wide. The wall has arrow slits set at 5-foot intervals and provides three‑quarters cover to creatures behind it. The wall remains in place for 1 hour or until you use an action while within 5 feet of the wall to don the shield. Each 10-foot‑by‑10-foot section of the wall has AC 17 and 30 hit points. If both sections of the wall are reduced to 0 hit points, the shield reverts to its normal form, and its magic ceases to function until the next dawn. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
