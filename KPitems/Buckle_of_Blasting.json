      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)</em><br>This soot-colored steel buckle has an exploding flame etched into its surface. It can be affixed to any common belt. While wearing this buckle, you have resistance to force damage. In addition, the buckle has 5 charges, and it regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn. It has the following properties.<br><em><strong>Blast.</strong></em> As an action, you can expend 2 charges to release a blast of magical energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 force damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from you. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t pushed. This blast deals triple damage to objects and structures, and it ignores damage thresholds of 10 or lower.<br><em><strong>Illuminate.</strong></em> As an action, you can expend 1 or more of the buckle’s charges to cause the buckle to shed light. It sheds warm, bright light in a 10-foot radius for each charge expended and dim light for an additional 10 feet for each charge expended. The light lasts for 1 hour or until you extinguish it (no action required).<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
