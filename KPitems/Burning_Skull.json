The skull helm radiates an unholy spectral aura, which sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. According to legends, gazing upon a burning skull freezes the blood and withers the brain of one who understands not its mystery.<br><em><strong>Gaze.</strong></em> The helm has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to gaze at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the helm’s gazes. Choose one of the following effects:<br>@@<pre><strong>Enervating Gaze.</strong> The target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength for 1 minute. It can make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br></pre><pre><strong>Paralyzing Gaze.</strong> The target is paralyzed for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br></pre>@@<strong>Phantasmal Gaze.</strong> The target takes 4d6 psychic damage at the start of each of its turns. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
