It is unquestionably a lovely item, a pale blue-white gem that gives off a faint glow. Surely its reputation is exaggerated?<br>While attuned to this item, you have advantage on all Charisma skill checks.<br><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> This item is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell or similar magic. Removing the item fails to end the curse on you. Whenever you fail a Wisdom skill check, the curse causes you to have disadvantage on all subsequent Wisdom skill checks until after you’ve taken a long rest.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
