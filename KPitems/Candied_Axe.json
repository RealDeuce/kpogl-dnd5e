      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (battleaxe), very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This battleaxe bears a golden head spun from crystalized honey. Its wooden handle is carved with reliefs of bees. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.<br><em><strong>Blessing of the Bee.</strong></em> While you are attuned to the axe, you have immunity to poison damage, and you have advantage on any Charisma check to interact with beasts.<br><em><strong>Honey Drip.</strong></em> While you are holding the battleaxe, you can use an action to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.yqUDoxk4x0NWG5Bz]{slow}</em> spell (save DC 15) from the weapon. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> The axe bears a curse that affects any non-bearfolk that attunes to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature’s physical appearance and stature become more bearlike. After 7 days, the creature looks like a typical bearfolk, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a bearfolk. The physical changes wrought by the axe can’t be dispelled, but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
