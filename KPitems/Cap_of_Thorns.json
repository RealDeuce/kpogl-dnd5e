      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>Donning this thorny wooden circlet causes it to meld with your scalp. It can be removed only upon your death or by a remove curse spell. The cap ingests some of your blood, dealing 2d4 piercing damage. After this first feeding, the thorns feed once per day for 1d4 piercing damage.<br>Once per day, you can sacrifice 1 hit point per level you possess to cast a special <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.gMrWeG8fMDPRFiVe]{entangle}</em> spell made of thorny vines. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this effect. Restrained creatures must make a successful Charisma saving throw or be affected by a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.eS7XnnApoxRxYXPs]{charm person}</em> spell as thorns pierce their body. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target fails three consecutive saves, the thorns become deeply rooted and the charmed effect is permanent until remove curse or similar magic is cast on the target.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
