      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this long, flowing cloak. Whenever you are within 10 feet of more than two creatures, it subtly and slowly shifts its color to whatever the creatures nearest you find the most irritating.<br>While within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you can use a bonus action to speak the cloak’s command word to activate it, allowing your allies’ ranged attacks to pass right through you. For 1 minute, each friendly creature that makes a ranged attack against a hostile creature within 5 feet of you has advantage on the attack roll. Each round the cloak is active, it enthusiastically and telepathically says “shoot me!” in different tones and cadences into the minds of each friendly creature that can see you and the cloak. The cloak can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
