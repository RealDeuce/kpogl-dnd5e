      "value": "<p><em>Potion, rare</em><br>This special elemental compound draws on nearby energy sources. Catalyst oils are tailored to one specific damage type (not including bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage) and have one dose. Whenever a spell or effect of this type goes off within 60 feet of a dose of catalyst oil, the oil catalyzes and becomes the spell’s new point of origin. If the spell affects a single target, its original point of origin becomes the new target. If the spell’s area is directional (such as a cone or a cube) you determine the spell’s new direction.<br>This redirected spell is easier to evade. Targets have advantage on saving throws against the spell, and the caster has disadvantage on the spell attack roll.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
