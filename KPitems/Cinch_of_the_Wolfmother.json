In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.<br><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> This belt is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell or similar magic. Removing the belt fails to end the curse on you.<br>If you are reduced to 0 hit points while attuned to the belt and fail two death saving throws, you die immediately as your body violently erupts in a shower of blood, and a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.EYiQZ3rFL25fEJY5]{dire wolf} emerges from your entrails. You assume control of the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.EYiQZ3rFL25fEJY5]{dire wolf}, and it gains additional hit points equal to half of your maximum hit points prior to death. The belt then crumbles and is destroyed.<br>If the wolf is targeted by a remove curse spell, then you are reborn when the wolf dies, just as the wolf was born when you died. However, if the curse remains after the wolf dies, you remain dead.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
