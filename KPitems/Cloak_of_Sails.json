      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>The interior of this simple, black cloak looks like white sailcloth. While wearing this cloak, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws. You lose this bonus while using the cloakâ€™s Sailcloth property.<br><em><strong>Sailcloth.</strong></em> While on the deck or roof of a vehicle powered by wind, you can use an action to spread this cloak out behind you to catch the wind as if it were an actual sail, increasing the movement speed of the vehicle by 30 feet. The cloak continues to function as a sail as long as you maintain concentration. If you leave the vehicle, this effect ends immediately.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
