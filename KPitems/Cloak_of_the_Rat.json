      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>While wearing this gray garment, you have a +5 bonus to your passive Wisdom (Perception) score.<br><em><strong>Rat Form.</strong></em> While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to cast <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.04nMsTWkIFvkbXlY]{polymorph}</em> on yourself, transforming into a rat. While you are in the form of the rat, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. In addition, you don’t need to maintain concentration on the spell, and the transformation lasts for 1 hour, until you use a bonus action to revert to your normal form, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die. Once used, this property of the cloak can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br><em><strong>Shrink.</strong></em> While wearing this cloak, you can use a bonus action to shrink in size as if you gained the “reduce” effect of the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WahI41a3goVUg0x1]{enlarge/reduce}</em> spell until the end of your next turn.
