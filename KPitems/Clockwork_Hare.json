      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary</em><br>Gifted by a deity of time and clockwork, these simpleâ€‘seeming trinkets portend some momentous event. The figurine resembles a hare with a clock in its belly. You can use an action to press the ears down and activate the clock, which spins chaotically. The hare emits a field of magic in a 30-foot radius from it for 1 hour. The field moves with the hare, remaining centered on it. While within the field, you and up to 5 willing creatures of your choice exist outside the normal flow of time, and all other creatures and objects are frozen in time. If an affected creature moves outside the field, the creature immediately becomes frozen in time until it is in the field again.<br>The field ends early if an affected creature attacks, touches, alters, or has any other physical or magical impact on a creature, or an object being worn or carried by a creature, that is frozen in time. When the field ends, the figurine turns into a nonmagical, living white hare that goes bounding off into the distance, never to be seen again.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
