      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Fabled (5th-Level and Higher Properties Require Attunement by a Spellcaster)</em><br>The dual nature of the <em>Codex Aeternus</em> is reflected in its two-tome binding, with “death” on the left and “life” on the right. The death tome contains necromantic rituals and treatises on the undead, while the life tome reflects on the nature of the divine and details healing methods and medicinal herbs. The owner of the grimoire gradually becomes interested in learning and performing funerary rites and medicinal remedies.<br>If attuned to it, you can use the grimoire as a spellcasting focus, and it functions as a spellbook for you. Moreover, when you finish a long rest while this tome is in your possession, you can choose either the chill touch or spare the dying cantrip. If you are holding the tome, you can cast the cantrip you selected at will.<br>When found, the book contains the following spells.<br>1st level: <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.uUWb1wZgtMou0TVP]{cure wounds}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ksaaTxIbKx2sJfia]{inflict wounds}</em><br>2nd level: <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressspells.Item.KPprayerofresolv]{prayer of resolve}, @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressspells.Item.KPwoundsurge0000]{wound surge}</em><br>3rd level: <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.oyE5nVppa5mde5gT]{animate dead}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.LmRHHMtplpxr9fX6]{revivify}</em><br>4th level: <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressspells.Item.KPdeathtoll00000]{death toll}, @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressspells.Item.KPhaloofbloodand]{halo of blood and tears}</em><br>5th level: <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressspells.Item.KPcontingencyboi]{contingency boils}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.AGFMPAmuzwWO6Dfz]{raise dead}</em><br>6th level: <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.E4NXux0RHvME1XgP]{create undead}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.tMH6Ivn4GmE1naMj]{harm}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qcYitWoSMTnKkzM1]{heal}</em><br>7th level: <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressspells.Item.KPdefilehealing0]{defile healing}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.HPvZm8YJO91k6Qdg]{finger of death}</em><br>9th level: <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressspells.Item.KPafflictline000]{afflict line}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.qLeEXZDbW5y4bmLY]{true resurrection}</em><br><em><strong>Tome of Duality (Requires Attunement).</strong></em> As your level increases, you gain the following benefits while the grimoire is on your person. Saving throws for its features equal your spell save DC.<br><strong>5th level.</strong> As a reaction when you take necrotic damage, you can transmute some of the damage into healing energy. You negate an amount of damage equal to 1d10 + your proficiency bonus and heal yourself or a creature of your choice within 10 feet by the same amount.<br><strong>9th level.</strong> As an action, one undead creature that you can see within 30 feet must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 8d6 radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by this attack, an exact copy of the creature appears in an adjacent unoccupied square and is under your control.<br>The copy has the statistics of the original creature as it was at the beginning of your turn. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command the copy if it is within 120 feet of you. You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. The copy lasts for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus, and then it vanishes.<br>You can use this feature three times and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.<br><strong>13th level.</strong> You can use your action to cast either the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.HPvZm8YJO91k6Qdg]{finger of death}</em> or the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.jhhT9PsHy5A7EojO]{resurrection}</em> spell. Once you do so, you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest. In addition, after you take damage from radiant or necrotic damage, you become immune to that type of damage for 1 minute. If you take damage from the other type while under the effect of this feature, you lose your immunity in favor of becoming immune to the new type, and the duration resets to 1 minute.<br><strong>17th level.</strong> Your Intelligence or Wisdom score (your choice) increases by 2, to a maximum of 20. An undead creature who targets you with an attack or harmful spell must first succeed on a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose that attack or spell. Moreover, whenever a spell or effect that restores hit points is used within 30 feet of your position, you regain hit points equal to half as much as the original spell or effect.<br><em><strong>Quirks of the Codex Aeternus.</strong></em> While attuned to the grimoire, you occasionally experience the emotions and attitudes of its previous owners, who have left their psychic imprint upon it. While you are not compelled to act on these feelings, you might randomly experience one of the quirks presented in the Quirks of the Codex Aeternus table.<br><h3>Quirks of the Codex Aeternus</h3><table><tr><th>d8</th><th>Result</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Funerals and ways that creatures die are amazingly interesting to you.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Sometimes your reflection shows what you’d look like if you were undead.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>There is always time to lecture the uninformed about cycles of life, death, and undeath.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>While no stranger to violence, you abhor killing anything yourself.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>You are obsessed with cleanliness.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>You are quick to point out the potential for major injury in every action.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>You collect grave dirt and keep your “treasures” in labeled jars.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>You instinctively want to heal any injured creature you see.</td></tr></table><br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
