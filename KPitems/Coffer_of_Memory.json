      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This small golden box resembles a jewelry box and is easily mistaken for a common trinket. When attuned to the box, its owner can fill the box with mental images of important events lasting no more than 1 minute each. Any number of memories can be stored this way. These images are similar to a slide show from the bearer's point of view. On a command from its owner, the box projects a mental image of a requested memory so that whoever is holding the box at that moment can see it.<br>If a coffer of memory is found with memories already stored inside it, a newly-attuned owner can view a randomly-selected stored memory with a successful DC 15 Charisma check.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
