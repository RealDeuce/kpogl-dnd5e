      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)</em><br>This small statuette of a snow-topped, forested mountain seems remarkably detailed, yet it stands only about 4 inches tall. Stories tell that it was a gift from the bearfolk to the shadow fey priests of Hecate when they first came to the Shadow Realm and that it was once merely a <em>collapsible hill</em>. Over time, its power has grown as it travels from one owner to another. The priests of Hecate say no one can retain it for more than a year.<br>When you hold the <em>collapsible mountain</em>, you may take an action to speak its command word to instantaneously create a pine-covered mountain, fully 2,500 feet tall. You may choose to either have the mountain rise under you or to have the mountain rise under another creature you can see at least 120 feet away. In the first case, other creatures nearby may wind up hundreds of feet below you (and combat ends between any two non-adjacent creatures). Groups of creatures move roughly 2d6 × 100 feet apart. If you have the mountain rise under another creature, you and adjacent creatures see the mountain grow rapidly nearby, but you remain at the altitude you started at. A small spring or brook usually appears nearby in this instance.<br>Each day, the mountain’s land and streams provide simple food and fresh, cold water sufficient to nourish 15 humanoids or five steeds.<br>Speaking the command word again collapses the mountain. Any creature standing on it is not harmed (the descent is swift but not dangerous). Creatures who enter combat unaware of the nature of the <em>collapsible mountain</em> are treated as if surprised by the sudden change.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
