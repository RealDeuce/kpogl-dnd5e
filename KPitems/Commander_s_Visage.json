      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This golden mask resembles a stern face, glowering at the world. While wearing this mask, you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. The mask has 7 charges for the following properties, and it regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at midnight.<br><em><strong>Commander’s Call.</strong></em> You can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to bark a command at one ally you can see within 30 feet of you. The target can use its reaction to move up to half its speed and make one attack.<br><em><strong>Conscription.</strong></em> You can use an action to expend 2 of its charges to conscript one humanoid within 60 feet of you that can see the mask. This conscription works like the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.91Sw6vOIaO7U8DvM]{dominate person}</em> spell, except it lasts 1 minute, requiring no concentration. You can have only one humanoid conscripted at a time. If you conscript another, the effect on the previous target ends.<br><em><strong>Unsettling Glower.</strong></em> When a creature that can see the mask makes a melee attack against you, you can use your reaction to spend 1 charge to force the target to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
