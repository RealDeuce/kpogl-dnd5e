      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)</em><br>This piece of dead, white brain coral glistens with a myriad of colors when placed underwater. While holding this coral underwater, you can use an action to cause a beam of colored light to streak from the coral toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. The beam’s color determines its effects, as described below. Each color can be used only once. The coral regains the use of all of its colors at the next dawn if it is immersed in water for at least 1 hour.<br><em><strong>Green.</strong></em> On a failed save, the target is transformed into a Tiny fish, such as a herring or salmon, for 1 hour. This effect works like the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.04nMsTWkIFvkbXlY]{polymorph}</em> spell, except you don’t need to maintain concentration on the effect. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each minute, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><em><strong>Yellow.</strong></em> On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 radiant damage and suffers two levels of exhaustion as its body is rapidly drained of moisture. On a successful save, the target takes half the damage and doesn’t suffer exhaustion.<br><em><strong>Blue.</strong></em> On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 cold damage and is paralyzed for 1 minute. On a successful save, the target takes half the damage and isn’t paralyzed. The paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><em><strong>Pink.</strong></em> On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 acid damage and is wracked with pain for 1 minute. On a successful save, the target takes half the damage and isn’t wracked with pain. While wracked with pain, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
