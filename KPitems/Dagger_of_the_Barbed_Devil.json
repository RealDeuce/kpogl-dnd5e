      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (dagger), rare</em><br>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.<br>You can use an action to cause sharp, pointed barbs to sprout from this blade. The barbs remain for 1 minute. When you hit a creature while the barbs are active, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or a barb breaks off into its flesh and the dagger loses its barbs. At the start of each of its turns, a creature with a barb in its flesh must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of its next turn as it is wracked with pain. The barb remains until a creature uses its action to remove the barb, dealing 1d4 piercing damage to the barbed creature. Once you cause barbs to sprout from the dagger, you canâ€™t do so again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
