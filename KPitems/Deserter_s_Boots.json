      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>While you wear these boots, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, and you gain a +1 bonus to Dexterity saving throws.<br><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> These boots are cursed. Attuning to them extends the curse to you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. Removing the boots fails to end the curse on you. If an ally you can see is within 5 feet of a creature hostile to your ally, your speed is halved when you move away from that ally. If more than one ally is within 5 feet of a creature hostile to it, you suffer this penalty only when you move away from all of those allies.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
