      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>When you wear this burgundy face covering, it transforms your face into a shark-like visage, and the mask sprouts wicked horns. While wearing this mask, your bite is a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic bite. In addition, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks while wearing this mask.<br><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> The mask is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the mask, wearing it at all times. If you haven’t used the mask’s bite to damage a creature in the past 24 hours, the mask compels you to bite out a chunk of your flesh. You take 2d6 necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the curse is removed. If your hit point maximum is reduced to 0 as a result of this curse, you die, transform into a @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.Actor.KPdevilshark0000]{devil shark}, and teleport to the nearest open body of water.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
