      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, common</em><br>This gold coin is plain and matches the dominant coin of the region. Typically, 2d6 <em>distracting doubloons</em> are found together.<br>You can use an action to toss the coin up to 20 feet. The coin bursts into a flash of golden light on impact. Each creature within a 15-foot radius of where the coin landed must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature or object other than the coin for 1 minute. If an affected creature takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. At the end of the duration, the coin crumbles to dust and is destroyed.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
