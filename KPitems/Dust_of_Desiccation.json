      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>This small packet contains soot-like dust. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to blow the choking dust from your palm, each creature in a 30-foot cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails this saving throw canâ€™t speak until the end of its next turn as it chokes on the dust.<br>Alternatively, you can use an action to throw the dust into the air, affecting yourself and each creature within 30 feet of you with the dust.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
