      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>Aside from a minor difference in size, these simple golden hoops are identical to one another. Each hoop has 1 charge and provides a different magical effect. Each hoop regains its expended charge daily at dawn. You must be wearing both hoops to use the magic of either hoop.<br><em><strong>Small Hoop.</strong></em> You can use an action to expend this hoop’s charge and choose a 10-foot by 10-foot area you can see. For 10 minutes, you can hear all sounds as though you were standing within that area. You can end this effect at any time.<br><em><strong>Large Hoop.</strong></em> While you are hidden, you can use an action to expend this hoop’s charge to conceal your presence from nearby creatures. Choose a point you can see within 120 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of that point has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to see, hear, and smell you for 1 minute. This effect ends early if you are no longer hidden.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
