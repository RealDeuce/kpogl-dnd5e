      "value": "<p><em>Potion, uncommon</em><br>This clear liquid glitters with miniscule particles of light. A bottle of this potion contains 6 doses, and its lid comes with a built-in dropper. You can use an action to apply 1 dose to the eyes of a blinded creature. The blinded condition is suppressed for 2d4 rounds. If the blinded condition has a duration, subtract those rounds from the total duration; if doing so reduces the overall duration to 0 rounds or less, then the condition is removed rather than suppressed. This eyewash doesnâ€™t work on creatures that are naturally blind, such as @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.GpeQYtlo8oGvGlkM]{grimlocks}, or creatures blinded by severe damage or removal of their eyes.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
