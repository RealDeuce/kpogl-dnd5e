      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, common</em><br>It is customary in many faiths to weight a corpse’s eyes with pennies so they have a fee to pay the ferryman when he comes to row them across death’s river to the afterlife. <em>Ferryman’s coins</em>, though, ensure the body stays in the ground regardless of the spirit’s destination. These coins, which feature a death’s head on one side and a lock and chain on the other, prevent a corpse from being raised as any kind of undead. When you place two coins on a corpse’s closed lids and activate them with a simple prayer, they can’t be removed unless the person is resurrected (in which case they simply fall away), or someone makes a DC 15 Strength check to remove them. Yanking the coins away does no damage to the corpse.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
