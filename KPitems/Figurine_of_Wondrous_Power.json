It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can’t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges. While in bull form, it is considered to be a Huge creature for the purpose of determining its carrying capacity, and nonmagical difficult terrain doesn’t cost it extra movement.<br><em><strong>Lapis Camel (Rare).</strong></em> This lapis camel can become a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.FQMFuzzSh73d0Nrd]{camel}. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in camel form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can’t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges. While in camel form, the lapis camel has a blue tint to its fur, and it can spit globs of acid at a creature that attacks it or its rider.

It can become a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.EYiQZ3rFL25fEJY5]{dire wolf} for up to 6 hours. At your command, it can cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.IBJmWjzbQGu7M4UX]{fog cloud}</em> spell. Each time it does, its duration is reduced by 1 hour. Once its duration ends, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed.<br><em><strong>Tin Dog (Common).</strong></em> This simple, tin statuette can become a dog for up to 8 hours, loyally following your commands to the best of its abilities.
