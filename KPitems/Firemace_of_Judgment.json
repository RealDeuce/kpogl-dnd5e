      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (mace; requires attunement)</em><br>When you roll initiative, remove all flame notations from the firemace of judgment. The first time in each encounter any character completes a firemace edict, put a flame notation on the firemace.<br>Once per battle as a bonus action, you may shout a hymn of retribution and ignite the firemace. Remove all flame notations from the firemace. The next time you hit a monster during this battle with a melee attack using the firemace, deal 10 (2d8 + 1) extra fire damage for each flame notation removed. If the monster is a demon or undead, it also must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of your next turn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
