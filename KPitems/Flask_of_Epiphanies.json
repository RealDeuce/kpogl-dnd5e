      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)</em><br>This flask is made of silver and cherry wood, and it holds finely cut garnets on its faces. This ornate flask contains 5 ounces of powerful alcoholic spirits. As an action, you can drink up to 5 ounces of the flaskâ€™s contents. You can drink 1 ounce without risk of intoxication. When you drink more than 1 ounce of the spirits as part of the same action, you must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw (this DC increases by 1 for each ounce you imbibe after the second, to a maximum of DC 15). On a failed save, you are incapacitated for 1d4 hours and gain no benefits from consuming the alcohol. On a success, your Intelligence or Wisdom (your choice) increases by 1 for each ounce you consumed. Whether you fail or succeed, your Dexterity is reduced by 1 for each ounce you consumed. The effect lasts for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) and Inteligence (Religion) checks. The flask replenishes 1d3 ounces of spirits daily at dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
