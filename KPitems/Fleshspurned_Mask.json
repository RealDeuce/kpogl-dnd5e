      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This mask features inhumanly sized teeth similar in appearance to the toothy ghost known as a @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.Actor.KPfleshspurned00]{fleshspurned}. It has a strap fashioned from entwined strands of sinew, and it fits easily over your face with no need to manually adjust the strap.<br>While wearing this mask, you can use its teeth to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, the teeth deal necrotic damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, if the target has the Incorporeal Movement trait, you deal necrotic damage equal to 2d6 + your Strength modifier instead. Such targets don’t have resistance or immunity to the necrotic damage you deal with this attack. If you kill a creature with your teeth, you gain temporary hit points equal to double the creature’s challenge rating (minimum of 1).<br><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> This mask is cursed. Becoming attuned to it and wearing it extends the curse to you. While cursed, you can’t remove the mask unless you are targeted by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell. In addition, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than the mask’s teeth. If you finish a long rest and haven’t used the mask’s teeth to deal damage to a creature since your previous long rest, you gain the Incorporeal Movement trait until you damage a creature with the mask’s teeth. The Incorporeal Movement trait allows you to move through creatures and solid objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside an object. Each hour you have the Incorporeal Movement trait, you have a 10 percent chance of encountering a hungry @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressmonsters.Actor.KPfleshspurned00]{fleshspurned} attracted to your plight.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
