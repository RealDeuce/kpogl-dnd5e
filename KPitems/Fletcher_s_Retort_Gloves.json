If you reduce the damage to 0 in this way and spend 1 ki point to throw the missile, the attack has a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet.<br>In addition, when a friendly creature within 5 feet of you is hit with a ranged weapon attack while you are wearing these gloves, you can use Deflect Missiles to deflect or catch the missile.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
