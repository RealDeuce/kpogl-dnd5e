      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>While lit, the flame in this ornate mithril lantern turns blue and sheds a cold, blue dim light in a 30-foot radius. After the lantern’s flame has burned for 1 hour, it can’t be lit again until the next dawn. You can extinguish the lantern’s flame early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the lantern’s total burn time.<br>When a creature enters the lantern’s light for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be vulnerable to cold damage until the start of its next turn. When you light the lantern, choose up to four creatures you can see within 30 feet of you, which can include yourself. The chosen creatures are immune to this effect of the lantern’s light.<br><em><strong>Freezing Light.</strong></em> While holding this lit lantern, you can use an action to force the lantern’s flame to emit a freezing chill. Each creature in the lantern’s light must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. For 1 minute, the lantern’s flame continues emitting wisps of cold air, making the area in the light difficult terrain as surfaces become slick with frost. Each creature you chose when you lit the lantern is also immune to this freezing light, and the difficult terrain caused by this freezing light doesn’t cost it extra movement. Once used, this property of the lantern can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
