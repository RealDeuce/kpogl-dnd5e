      "value": "<p><em>Armor (Half Plate), Legendary (Requires Attunement)</em><br>Said to be crafted by imbuing the hide of a void dragon with null matter and binding it with shadow, this black armor seems to contain stars, comets, and wispy, void-like veils of purple, red, and blue. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. In addition, the wielder of any manufactured weapon that successfully hits you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the weapon deals damage normally, and if it’s nonmagical, it then crumbles to dust and is destroyed, but if it’s magical, it instead is sapped of all magical properties until after the wielder takes a short or long rest (though it is still considered magical, such as for overcoming damage resistance). Creatures that hit you with natural weapons, must also make the saving throw, dealing damage normally but then taking 1d12 necrotic damage on a failed save.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
