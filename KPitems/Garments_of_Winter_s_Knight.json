      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)</em><br>This white-and-blue outfit is designed in the style of fey nobility and maximized for both movement and protection. The multiple layers and snow-themed details of this garb leave no doubt that whoever wears these clothes is associated with the winter queen of faerie. You gain the following benefits while wearing the outfit:<ul><li>If you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 15 + your Dexterity modifier.</li><li>Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the cloth steals heat from the surrounding air, and the attacker takes 2d8 cold damage.</li><li>You can’t be charmed, and you are immune to cold damage.</li><li>You can use a bonus action to extend your senses outward to detect the presence of fey. Until the start of your next turn, you know the location of any fey within 60 feet of you.</li><br><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> This item is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you until you are targeted by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell or similar magic; removing the outfit fails to end the curse. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the outfit. While cursed, all fey creatures not in service to the faerie queen of winter are hostile toward you.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
