      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em><br>Scales from dead dragons cover this wooden, curved horn. You can use an action to speak the horn’s command word and then blow the horn, which emits a blast in a 30-foot cone, containing shrieking spectral dragon heads. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature tales 5d10 psychic damage and is frightened of you for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t frightened. Dragons have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d10 psychic damage instead of 5d10. A frightened target can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br>If a dragon takes damage from the horn’s shriek, the horn has a 20 percent chance of exploding. The explosion deals 10d10 psychic damage to the blower and destroys the horn.<br>Once you use the horn, it can’t be used again until the next dawn. If you kill a dragon while holding or carrying the horn, you regain use of the horn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
