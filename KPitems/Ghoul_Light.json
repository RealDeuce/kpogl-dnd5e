      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em><br>This bullseye lantern sheds light as normal when a lit candle is placed inside of it. If the light shines on meat, no matter how toxic or rotten, for at least 10 minutes, the meat is rendered safe to eat. The lantern’s magic doesn’t improve the meat’s flavor, but the light does restore the meat’s nutritional value and purify it, rendering it free of poison and disease. In addition, when an undead creature ends its turn in the light, it takes 1 radiant damage.<br><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> When a creature eats meat that has been rendered edible by this lantern’s light, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become cursed until it is targeted by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell or similar magic. While cursed, the creature has a craving for the flesh of humanoid corpses. If the cursed creature goes longer than 7 days without consuming at least 1 ounce of flesh from a dead humanoid, it can’t regain hit points by any means until it consumes such flesh.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
