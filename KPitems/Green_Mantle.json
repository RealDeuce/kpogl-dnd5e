      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This garment is made of living plants—mosses, vines, and grasses—interwoven into a light, comfortable piece of clothing. When you attune to this mantle, it forms a symbiotic relationship with you, sinking roots beneath your skin. While wearing the mantle, your hit point maximum is reduced by 5, and you gain the following benefits:<ul><li>If you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 13 + your Dexterity modifier.</li><li>You have resistance to radiant damage.</li><li>You have immunity to the poisoned condition and poison damage that originates from a plant, moss, fungus, or plant creature.</li><li>As an action, you cause the mantle to produce 6 berries. It can have no more than 12 berries on it at one time. The berries have the same effect as berries produced by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Qf6CAZkc7ms4ZY3e]{goodberry}</em> spell. Unlike the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Qf6CAZkc7ms4ZY3e]{goodberry}</em> spell, the berries retain their potency as long as they are not picked from the mantle. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.</li><br><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> Once you don and attune to this cursed mantle, you are cursed and can’t remove it unless you are targeted by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell or similar magic. The mantle requires at least 1 pint of water each day. If you fail to provide water to it, it draws the moisture it needs from your body, dealing 3d6 necrotic damage to you. If it is unable to gain moisture, due to its host’s immunities or magical protections or being in a dry environment on a dead host, the mantle begins to wither. After the first 24 hours it is unable to gain moisture, the Armor Class it provides is reduced by 1, and you lose resistance to radiant damage. After 48 hours without moisture, it no longer provides an Armor Class, and you lose immunity to the poisoned condition and plant-based poison damage. After 72 hours without moisture, it dies, becoming nonmagical, and you are able to remove it.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
