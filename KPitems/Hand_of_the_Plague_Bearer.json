      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item (requires attunement)</em><br>When you attune yourself to the <em>hand of the plague bearer</em>, you cannot get rid of it.<br>On your turn as a bonus action, you may reach out and touch an adjacent ally with the <em>hand</em>. If you do, name one curse, disease, or condition affecting that ally and make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw.<br>On a success, one finger of the <em>hand</em> absorbs the curse, disease, or condition, curing that ally. Write the name of the absorbed affliction down. On a failure, the hand still absorbs the curse, disease, or condition as above. However, the hand animates immediately afterward and strangles you for one round, inflicting 4 (1d8) points of bludgeoning damage and inflicting any afflictions upon you it has already absorbed. You suffer each affliction borne by it until you finish a short rest.<br>When the <em>hand</em> has absorbed five afflictions, it withers away to dried maggots (but not before it chokes the attuned character and inflicts all five afflictions if the Charisma saving throw was failed).<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
