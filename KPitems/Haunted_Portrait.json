      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Rare</em><br>These masterful portraits can be of any style or subject, though they typically contain one or more humanoid creatures. There are two varieties of haunted portrait: benevolent and malevolent.<br>Both are activated by hanging on a vertical surface and speaking its command word within 5 feet of it. It remains activated unless its command word is spoken again or unless it is removed from the wall. Removing a <em>haunted portrait</em> from its hanger while it is active requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or you feel compelled to leave it where it is.<br><em><strong>Malevolent Haunted Portrait.</strong></em> These portraits depict an intimidating, dour, or fearful mood, inspiring feelings of paranoia and dread. The eyes in these portraits follow you, and the paintingâ€™s shadows shift in sinister ways when you look away.<br>All creatures within 30 feet of a <em>malevolent haunted portrait</em> they can see suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and saving throws made to resist becoming frightened. Creatures immune to fear are also immune to this effect.<br><em><strong>Benevolent Haunted Portrait.</strong></em> These portraits have a lighter mood, depicting subjects that are sometimes sad but often dreamy, happy, or nostalgic. The details of the painting shift when you look away, but the changes are benign.<br>Once per day, one creature may ask the <em>benevolent haunted portrait</em> a question (in any non-secret language). Over the course of 1 minute, details in the painting shift to provide a clue relevant to the question asked.
