When you cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Qf6CAZkc7ms4ZY3e]{goodberry}</em> spell while using this wand as your spellcasting focus, you can expend 1 of the wandâ€™s charges to transform the berries into hazelnuts, which restore 2 hit points instead of 1. The spell is otherwise unchanged. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals lightning damage while using this wand as your spellcasting focus, the spell deals 1 extra lightning damage.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
