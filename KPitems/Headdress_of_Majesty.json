While you wear this headdress, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks. The headdress has 5 charges for the following properties. It regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the headdress becomes a nonmagical, tawdry ornament of cheap metals and paste gems.<br><em><strong>Command.</strong></em> While wearing the headdress, you can use an action to expend 1 or more charges to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.arzCrMRgcNiQuh43]{command}</em> spell (save DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.<br><em><strong>Enchanting Sovereign.</strong></em> When you cast an enchantment spell while wearing the headdress, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to strengthen the spell. While the spell is strengthened, each target has disadvantage on the saving throw. If you are also attuned to and holding a <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressitems.Item.KPscepterofmajes]{scepter of majesty}</em>, the save DC of the strengthened spell increases by 1.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
