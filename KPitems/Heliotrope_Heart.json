      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>This polished orb of dark-green stone is latticed with pulsing crimson inclusions that resemble slowly dilating spatters of blood. While attuned to this orb, your hit point maximum can’t be reduced by the bite of a vampire, vampire spawn, or other vampiric creature.<br>In addition, while holding this orb, you can use an action to speak its command word and cast the 2nd-level version of the false life spell. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dusk.<br><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> This orb is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the orb or you attune to it. Attuning to the orb curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the orb, keeping it on your person at all times. While cursed, your shadow seems abnormally gaunt and sometimes moves of its own volition as though alive. As a result, you have disadvantage on Charisma (Performance) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
