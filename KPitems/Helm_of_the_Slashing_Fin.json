You can speak its command word again or remove the helm as an action to end this effect.<br><em><strong>Fin Slash.</strong></em> The helm has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to swing your head in the direction of a target you can see within 10 feet of you. The helmâ€™s fin extends and makes an attack roll with a +5 bonus. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 slashing damage. If you move at least 20 feet straight toward the target and the fin hits on the same turn, the hit is a critical hit.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
