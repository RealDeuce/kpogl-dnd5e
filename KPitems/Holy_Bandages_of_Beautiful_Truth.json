      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>A fist-sized bundle of loosely woven, decadently soft, gauze-like cotton, each of these bandages may be applied to a creature as an action, which provokes opportunity attacks. Once applied, the bandage does three things:<ul><li>The creature heals 2d8 + 2 hit points.</li><li>Any blindness suffered by the character is removed.</li><li>If used to bind a severed limb to the characterâ€™s body, that limb reattaches. If the limb is missing, it causes a new limb to regrow and become usable after 1d12 + 1 days as long as the character has at least 1 hp over that entire period.</li><br>If you are suffering from a poison, you can, instead, roll against its effects with advantage. The bandage works twice and is then consumed.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
