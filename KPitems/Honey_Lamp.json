      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em><br>Honey lamps, made from glowing honey encased in beeswax, shed light as a lamp. Though the lamps are often found in the shape of a globe, the honey can also be sealed inside stone or wood recesses. If the wax that shields the honey is broken or smashed, the honey crystallizes in 7 days and ceases to glow. Eating the honey while it is still glowing grants darkvision out to a range of 30 feet for 1 week and 1 day.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
