      "value": "<p><em>Rod, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This sturdy, iron rod is topped with the head of a howling wolf with red carnelians for eyes. The rod has 5 charges for the following properties, and it regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.<br><em><strong>Spectral Howl.</strong></em> While holding the rod, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause a spectral wolf head to appear above you and unleash a terrifying howl. Each creature within 20 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that arenâ€™t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. While frightened of you, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the howl of this rod for 24 hours.<br><em><strong>Wolf Bite.</strong></em> While holding the rod, you can use a bonus action to expend 2 of its charges to attack one frightened creature you can see within 20 feet of you. A spectral wolf head leaps out of the rod and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 force damage.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
