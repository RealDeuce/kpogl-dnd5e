Once summoned, the gilded devil serves you for up to 1 hour or until it is destroyed. If the gilded devil is destroyed, the icon cannot be used again for 7 days; otherwise, it can be used once every 24 hours.<br><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> A giant, fey, or humanoid attuned to the icon finds themselves filled with avaricious thoughts and must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw every time they summon the gilded devil or have their alignment changed to lawful evil. If the creature dies while its alignment is lawful evil, the gilded devil snatches up its soul for Mammon and departs. In this circumstance, the creature can only be restored to life by a carefully worded <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3okM6Gn63zzEULkz]{wish}</em>.<br>A creature can only regain its former alignment if a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> is cast on them.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
