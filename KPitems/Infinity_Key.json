      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a Follower of Ogun)</em><br>This key can take various forms, from an old key threaded with verdigris to a shiny new one, but its abilities remain the same regardless of its appearance. While attuned to the key, you can use an action to insert the key into any door lock and “pair” the key to that door.<br>If you later use an action to insert the key into a different door lock on the same plane of existence as the paired door, the current door will open to the location the paired door led to instead of its usual destination. This effect lasts for an hour. Any creature or object that passes through the door will end up where the original, paired door led. After the hour is finished, the key will not operate until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
