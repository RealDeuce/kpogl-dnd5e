While wearing this surcoat, you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks when interacting with horses, and you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with humanoids of a higher social rank than you, such as an army’s general or a region’s monarch.<br><em><strong>Knight’s Livery.</strong></em> While attuned to and wearing both the <em>knight-sergeant’s surcoat</em> and the <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressitems.Item.KPargentmantle00]{argent mantle}</em>, your Charisma score is 20.
