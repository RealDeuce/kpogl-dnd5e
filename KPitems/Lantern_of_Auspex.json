      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>This elaborate lantern is covered in simple glyphs, and its glass panels are intricately etched. Two of the panels depict a robed woman holding out a single hand, while the other two panels depict the same woman with her face partially obscured by a hand of cards. The lantern’s magic is activated when it is lit, which requires an action. Once lit, the lantern sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet for 1 hour. You can use an action to open or close one of the glass panels on the lantern. If you open a panel, a vision of a random event that happened or that might happen plays out in the light’s area. Closing a panel stops the vision. The visions are shown as nondescript smoky apparitions that play out silently in the lantern’s light. At the GM’s discretion, the vision might change to a different event each 1 minute that the panel remains open and the lantern lit. Once used, the lantern can’t be used in this way again until 7 days have passed.<br><em><strong>Hand Out Panel.</strong></em> If you open one panel depicting the woman with her hand out, the vision is of an event that happened within the past 1 year. If you open both, the vision is of an event that happened within the past 10 years.<br><em><strong>Cards Panel.</strong></em> If you open one panel depicting the woman with cards, the vision is of an event that might happen within the next 1 year. If you open both, the vision is of an event that might happen within the next 10 years.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
