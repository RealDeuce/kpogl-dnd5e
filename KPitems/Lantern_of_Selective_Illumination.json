During a short rest, you can choose up to three creatures to be magically linked by the lantern. When the lantern is lit, its light can be perceived only by you and those linked creatures. To anyone else, the lantern appears dark and provides no illumination.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
