The links of this mail have been stained to create the optical illusion that you are wearing a brown-and-russet feathered tunic. While you wear this armor, you have advantage on Charisma (Performance) checks made with an instrument.<br>In addition, while playing an instrument, you can use a bonus action and choose any number of creatures within 30 feet of you that can hear your song. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 minute.
