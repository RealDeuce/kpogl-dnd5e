      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (1 gem), very rare (2 gems), or legendary (4 gems) (requires attunement by a ley magic spellcaster)</em><br>This bronze amulet of elegant ramag craftsmanship features one or more citrine gems embedded in its design. The number of gems is determined by the amuletâ€™s rarity. A single gem can be charged by an attuned ley magic spellcaster when spending a long rest within 30 feet of a ley line. No two gems on a single amulet can be charged from the same ley line.<br>While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to expend the ley energy infused in a charged gem and open a portal for 1 round. For the duration, any creature can step into the portal by using 5 feet of movement and instantly appear within 5 feet of the location where the gem was originally charged or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
