      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, common</em><br>As an action, you can attach this tiny bronze gear to a pile of junk or other small collection of mundane objects and create a Tiny or Small mechanical servant. This servant uses the statistics of a beast with a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower, except it has immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and it canâ€™t be charmed or become exhausted.<br>If it participates in combat, the servant lasts for up to 5 rounds or until destroyed. If commanded to perform mundane tasks, such as fetching items, cleaning, or other similar task, it lasts for up to 5 hours or until destroyed.<br>Once affixed to the servant, the gear pulsates like a beating heart. If the gear is removed, you lose control of the servant, which then attacks indiscriminately for up to 5 rounds or until destroyed. Once the duration expires or the servant is destroyed, the gear becomes a nonmagical gear.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
