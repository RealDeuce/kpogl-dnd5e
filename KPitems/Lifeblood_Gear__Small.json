      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, common</em><br>This small bronze gear, if attached to a statue, pile of junk, or object, creates a small animated object. This animated object has the statistics of an animal with a challenge rating of 1‚ÅÑ4 or lower but has the construct type and is immune to poison, charm, and exhaustion.<br>The animated object lasts for 5 hours, if asked to perform non-combat tasks, or 5 rounds of combat. Once affixed, the gear pulsates like a beating heart. If the gear is removed, you lose control of the construct, which then attacks indiscriminately until its duration expires. Once the duration expires or the animated object is destroyed, the lifeblood gear becomes a normal, non-magical gear.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
