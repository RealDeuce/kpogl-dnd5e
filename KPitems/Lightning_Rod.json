      "value": "<p><em>Rod, very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This rod is made from the blackened wood of a lightning-struck tree and topped with a spike of twisted iron. It functions as a magic javelin that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you are immune to lightning damage, and each creature within 5 feet of you has resistance to lightning damage.<br>The rod can hold up to 6 charges, but it has 0 charges when you first attune to it. Whenever you are subjected to lightning damage, the rod gains 1 charge. While the rod has 6 charges, you have resistance to lightning damage instead of immunity. The rod loses 1d6 charges daily at dawn.<br><em><strong>Ground.</strong></em> You can use an action to drive the rod’s spiked tip into the ground, harmlessly emptying it of all its current charges.<br><em><strong>Lightning Bolt.</strong></em> While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 3 charges to cause a bolt of lightning to crackle out from the rod’s tip in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><em><strong>Lightning Shield.</strong></em> When you are attacked while holding the rod, you can use a reaction to expend 2 charges to cover yourself in a shield of arcing electrical sparks. Until the start of your next turn, when a creature hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you, it takes 2d8 lightning damage.<br><em><strong>Shocking Strike.</strong></em> When you hit with a melee attack using the rod, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 3d8 lightning damage to the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
