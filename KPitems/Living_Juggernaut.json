      "value": "<p><em>Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This broad, bulky suit of plate is adorned with large, blunt spikes and has curving bull horns affixed to its helm. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and difficult terrain doesn’t cost you extra movement.<br><em><strong>Juggernaut Rush.</strong></em> While wearing this armor, you can use the Dash action to move into and through the spaces of any creatures no more than one size larger than you, physically ramming into them as you pass. You can’t ram into a creature more than once during the same movement. Each creature you ram must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet away from your path. A creature that chooses not to be pushed or that chooses to make an opportunity attack against you suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your Strength modifier, and it is pushed 5 feet in a direction of your choice. Once used, this property of the armor can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
