      "value": "<p><em>Potion, rare</em><br>This pungent perfume has a woodsy and slightly musky scent. As an action, you can splash or spray the contents of this vial on yourself or another creature within 5 feet of you. For 1 minute, the perfumed creature attracts nearby humanoids and beasts.<br>Each humanoid and beast within 60 feet of the perfumed creature and that can smell the perfume must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the perfumed creature until the perfume fades or is washed off with at least 1 gallon of water. While charmed, a creature is incapacitated, and, if the creature is more than 5 feet away from the perfumed creature, it must move on its turn toward the perfumed creature by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesnâ€™t avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
