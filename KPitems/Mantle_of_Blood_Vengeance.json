While wearing it, you can visit retribution on any creature that dares spill your blood. When you take piercing, slashing, or necrotic damage from a creature, you can use a reaction to expend 1 charge to turn your blood into a punishing spray. The creature that damaged you must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
