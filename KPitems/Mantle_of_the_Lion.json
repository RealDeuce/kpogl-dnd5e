      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This splendid lion pelt is designed to be worn across the shoulders with the paws clasped at the base of the neck. While wearing this mantle, your speed increases by 10 feet, and the mantle’s lion jaws are a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, the mantle’s bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.<br>In addition, if you move at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hit it with a melee attack on the same turn, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If a creature is knocked prone in this way, you can make an attack with the mantle’s bite against the prone creature as a bonus action.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
