      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, or paladin)</em><br>This slender brooch is fashioned of silver and shaped in the image of an angel. You can use an action to attach this brooch to a creature, pinning it to clothing or otherwise affixing it to their person. When you cast a spell that restores hit points on the creature wearing the brooch, the spell has a range of 30 feet if its range is normally touch. Only you can transfer the brooch from one creature to another. The creature wearing the brooch can’t pass it to another creature, but it can remove the brooch as an action.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
