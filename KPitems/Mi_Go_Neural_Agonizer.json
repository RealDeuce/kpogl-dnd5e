      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>The mi-go manufacture and/or grow many inscrutable technological devices. The <em>neural agonizer</em> is a tool that aids them in capturing victims whose brains will be removed for study or for transport to Yuggoth. Like much mi-go technology, these devices don’t have a standard appearance or functioning system. Each one must be figured out individually (represented by attunement, which also requires a successful DC 19 Intelligence [Arcana] check to succeed).<br>The <em>neural agonizer</em> has 5 charges. While you hold the agonizer, you can use an action to make a Neural Agonizer attack (expends 1 charge; see below). If you are not a mi-go, you must make a successful DC 15 Intelligence saving throw when you make the attack or the weapon’s psychic damage affects you instead of your intended target.<br>The <em>neural agonizer</em> regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn. If the device is reduced to 0 charges, roll a d20. On a 1, the neural agonizer goes dead and never regains charges.<br><em><strong>Neural Agonizer.</strong> Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, range 10/40 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d6 + 5) psychic damage plus 7 (1d4 + 5) lightning damage, and a creature must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be paralyzed or stunned (50/50) for a number of rounds = 1d4 – the creature’s Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
