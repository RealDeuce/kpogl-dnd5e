      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>This 8-inch diameter mirror is set in a delicate, silver frame. While holding this mirror within 30 feet of another mirror, you can spend 10 minutes magically connecting the mirror of eavesdropping to that other mirror. The mirror of eavesdropping can be connected to only one mirror at a time.<br>While holding the mirror of eavesdropping within 1 mile of its connected mirror, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. While active, the mirror of eavesdropping displays visual information from the connected mirror, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The connected mirror’s view is limited to the direction the mirror is facing, and it can be blocked by a solid barrier, such as furniture, a heavy cloth, or similar. You can use a bonus action to deactivate the mirror early.<br>When the mirror has been active for a total of 10 minutes, you can’t activate it again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
