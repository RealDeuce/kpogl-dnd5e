      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em><br>This 10-foot tall standing stone is inlaid with silver runes and symbols of the moons, and weighs 7,500 pounds. When activated, the <em>moonlit ward</em> creates a 200-foot sphere of area safe from the Shadow Realmâ€™s corruption. This area is considered not to be part of the Shadow Realm for purposes of gaining or recovering from shadow corruption.<br>Activating the ward requires a special ritual that takes 8 hours to complete, performed on the night of a full moon, and it remains active until the next full moon. The ritual is detailed in the runes and carvings on the stone, and can be deciphered with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check.<br>If three or more <em>moonlit wards</em> are arranged to surround an area and activated, they purge shadow corruption from the area between them.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
