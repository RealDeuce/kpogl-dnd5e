      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads hanging from it, made from bone and ivory. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead expands to become a monster. The GM decides the type of each bead or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type unless indicated.<table><tr><th>D20</th><th>Summoned Creature</th></tr><tr><td>1–6</td><td>One giant centipede</td></tr><tr><td>7–12</td><td>One worg or two giant centipedes</td></tr><tr><td>13–16</td><td>One owlbear or four worgs</td></tr><tr><td>17–18</td><td>One bulette or two owlbears</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>One chimera or two bulettes</td></tr><tr><td>20*</td><td>One young blue dragon or two chimeras</td></tr></table><br>*(only 1 bead of this type is allowed)</table><br>The summoned creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. The creature lasts for 1 minute before vanishing.</table><br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
