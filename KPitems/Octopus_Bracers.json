      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>These bronze bracers are etched with depictions of frolicking octopuses. While wearing these bracers, you can use an action to speak their command word and transform your arms into tentacles. You can use a bonus action to repeat the command word and return your arms to normal.<br>The tentacles are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Your reach extends by 5 feet while your arms are tentacles. When you hit with a tentacle, it deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). If you hit a creature of your size or smaller than you, it is grappled. Each tentacle can grapple only one target. While grappling a target with a tentacle, you can’t attack other creatures with that tentacle.<br>While your arms are tentacles, you can’t wield weapons that require two hands, and you can’t wield shields. In addition, you can’t cast a spell that has a somatic component.<br>When the bracers’ property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
