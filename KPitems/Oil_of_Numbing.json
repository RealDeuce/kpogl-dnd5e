      "value": "<p><em>Potion, common</em><br>This astringent-smelling oil stings slightly when applied to flesh, but the feeling quickly fades. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. For 1 hour, the affected creature has advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain its concentration on a spell when it takes damage, and it has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to endure pain. However, the affected creatureâ€™s flesh is slightly numbed and senseless, and it has disadvantage on ability checks that require fine motor skills or a sense of touch.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
