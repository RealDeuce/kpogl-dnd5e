If drunk, the elixir confers the ability to breathe both air and water with equal ease. If rubbed on the feet, the elixir provides a creature with the ability to walk on water as if wearing a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.items.Item.LC5LsQOPwoHQW9Mi]{ring of water walking}</em>. If placed on the hull of a boat or similar vessel, the vessel gains a damage threshold of 20 against all environmental effects, and anyone piloting the vessel has advantage on ability checks associated with it. All of these effects are permanent.<br><em><strong>Ingredients.</strong></em> The scale of a merfolk princess, a vial of pure elemental water, and the eye of a kraken.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
