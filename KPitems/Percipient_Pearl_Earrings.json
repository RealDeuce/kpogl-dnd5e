The conversation can be played back for up to 24 hours by pressing the right earring with two fingers. You decide if only you can hear the recording or if it can be heard by anyone within 10 feet.</li><br>Both effects can be activated at the same time, if desired.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
