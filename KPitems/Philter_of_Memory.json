      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>This swirling liquid is the collected memory of a mortal who willingly traded that memory away to the shadow fey. The shadow fey collects the offered memory and stores it in a vial carved of semiprecious gemstone worth 250 gp. When you touch the philter, you feel a flash of the emotion contained within. You can unstopper and pour out a philter as an action unless otherwise specified. The philter’s effects take place immediately, either on you or on a creature you can see within 30 feet (your choice). If the target is unwilling, it can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to resist the effect of the philter. A creature affected by a philter experiences the memory contained in the vial. A Mnemosyne philter can be used only once, but the vial can be reused to store a new memory.<br><h2>Bonds of Friendship</h2><br>You swore an oath of blood and mingled tears; both of you against the injustice of the shadow fey. Goblin blood held true, a dozen years of watchful friendship and laughter behind the courtier’s backs. No harm must come to your closest companion!<br>As a reaction when a creature you can see within 30 feet targets you or an ally with a weapon attack or a spell, you can pour out the philter. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or choose a different target. If it can’t or doesn’t choose a different target, the attack or spell is wasted. A creature that can’t be charmed is immune to this effect.<br>To create this philter, a humanoid must sacrifice a happy memory of a time with a friend.<br><h2>Coward’s Shame</h2><br>You remember how the queen banished you for your cowardice and how the court laughed. Even your mother turned her back. You could not return to the courts until she died.<br>The target becomes frightened. While frightened in this way, it flees from you by the most direct route it can, and it can take only actions that facilitate its escape. If the creature ends its turn more than 30 feet away from you and can’t see you, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.<br>To create this philter, a humanoid must sacrifice a memory of a failure or embarrassment.<br><h2>Youthful Joy</h2><br>You remember the sunshine and the shadows of the ancient forest, picking bluebells as a young girl: the laughter of a child and the boundless strength of youth. The target regains 3d8 + 6 hit points and removes one level of exhaustion.<br>To create this philter, a humanoid must sacrifice a favored childhood memory.<br><h2>Raging Lust</h2><br>You tore her spider silk bridal dress in the treetops and dropped the shreds to the forest floor. You shook the leaves from the trees, and her cries set the birds to flight. You would have done anything she asked.<br>The target is charmed by you, until you or one of your allies does something to harm the target. If you are a kind of creature the target normally finds attractive, it treats you as the object of its desire while it is charmed in this way. You can make one suggestion of the target (as if using the suggestion spell). The target can repeat the saving throw when it finishes a long rest. On a failed save, it remains charmed and you can make another suggestion; on a successful save, the effect ends.<br>To create this philter, a humanoid must sacrifice all memory of a romantic partner.<br><h2>Philter of Righteous Wrath</h2><br>The queen’s rage swept everything before her, and you—her champion—destroyed all you touched. Die, traitor! Die, faithless creatures!<br>When you activate this philter, each creature other than you within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be overcome by burning ferocity. Until the start of your next turn, an affected creature must attack a foe if it is able, and every attack made by an affected creature that hits is automatically a critical hit.<br>To create this philter, a humanoid must sacrifice all memory of a great victory in battle.<br><h2>Philter of Widow’s Tears</h2><br>She died in your arms, the glorious spider-maiden who spun your wedding vest and embroidered the lace you wore so proudly. Oh, that it should end thus. She was always the one who was meant to outlive your foolish plotting.<br>A creature you can see within 30 feet is overcome by devastating grief. The target is stunned for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br>To create this philter, a humanoid must sacrifice all memory of a deceased loved one.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
