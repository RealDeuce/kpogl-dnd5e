      "value": "<p><em>Potion, Uncommon</em><br>As you imbibe this potion, you are overtaken with feelings of anger and memories of justice denied, betrayals, or blasphemy—the specific memories depend on the philter’s creator. You must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be overcome by a fit of rage for 1 minute. While in a fit of rage, you have advantage on melee attack rolls, and your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 3 (1d6) damage. You cannot distinguish friend from foe and must attack the nearest creature. If no creatures are nearby, you must dash in the direction of the nearest living creature. If no other creature is near enough to move to and attack, you stalk off in a random direction, seeking a target for your anger. On a successful saving throw, only the memories are passed to you. You can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of your turns, ending the effect on a success.<br>The effects of this philter cancel the effects of a <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressitems.Item.KPphilterofmercy]{philter of mercy}</em>.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
