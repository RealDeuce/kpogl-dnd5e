      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (hand crossbow), very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This hand crossbow is made from coal-colored wood. Its limb is made from cold steel and boasts engravings of sharp teeth. The barrel is magically oiled and smells faintly of ash. The grip is made from rough leather.<br>You gain a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack with this weapon, you can force the target of your attack to succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet away from you. The target takes damage, as normal, whether it was pushed away or not.<br>As a bonus action, you can increase the distance creatures are pushed to 20 feet for 1 minute. If the creature strikes a solid object before the movement is complete, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet traveled. Once used, this property of the crossbow canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
