      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)</em><br>Usually seen on the grim faces of plague doctors that treat diseased patients, this mask covers the top half of your face with stiff black leather, and an elongated beak extends out from your nose.<br>When you don the mask, you smell an assortment of pungent, almost-sweet herbs and flowers stuffed into the beak and magically held there and preserved. You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks requiring scent due to the strength of the remedies, but you gain advantage on your saving throws against attacks based on gases or scents, including <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.TwlD4PLcltv7Xh7j]{stinking cloud}</em> and <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.LkvI11Uue774QBKZ]{cloudkill}</em>.<br>Once per long rest, you can spend an action to focus on breathing in the aromas to soften your fatigue and remove a level of exhaustion.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
