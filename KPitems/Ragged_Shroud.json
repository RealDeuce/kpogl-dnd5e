      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>These ragged grey cloaks are death shrouds taken from actual tombs and enchanted to hide a living humanoid creature from the notice of the undead. All undead with a Wisdom score of 11 or lower consider you as undead and ignore you unless directly attacked or addressed by you. Any undead with a Wisdom score of 12 or higher can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to see through the illusion. (If you are in sunlight, the undead rolls with advantage.)<br>The shroud becomes non-magical and crumbles to dust 24 hours after it is first worn or if it is exposed to sunlight for more than an hour.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
