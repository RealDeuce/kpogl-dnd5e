      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Common</em><br>This seed must be used outdoors, and when thrown, you gain control of the weather within a 5-mile radius for up to 1d8 hours. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind, shifting the weather within 30 minutes, for instance, from a clear day to a cloudy and rainy one, from warm to arctic cold, and from moderate winds to a storm. The effects of a <em>rain and thunder seed</em> must always make the weather less pleasant than they were before: colder, rainier, and windier, never the reverse. While the seed often produces thunder, any lightning does not strike near you, but neither is the lightning under your control.<br>The effects of a rain and thunder seed can be countered or dispelled by either a <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.ZPd73HtKF3At11jh]{control weather}</em> or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Ek45cBpVXvJdv1Qy]{counterspell}</em> spell.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
