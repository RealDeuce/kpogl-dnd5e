      "value": "<p><em>Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>This polished brass ring has 3 charges. While wearing the ring, you are inspired to daring acts that risk life and limb, especially if such acts would impress or intimidate others who witness them. When you choose a course of action that could result in serious harm or possible death (your GM has final say in if an action qualifies), you can expend 1 of the ringâ€™s charges to roll a d10 and add the number rolled to any d20 roll you make to achieve success or avoid damage, such as a Strength (Athletics) check to scale a sheer cliff and avoid falling or a Dexterity saving throw made to run through a hallway filled with swinging blades.<br>The ring regains all expended charges daily at dawn. In addition, if you fail on a roll boosted by the ring, and you failed the roll by only 1, the ring regains 1 expended charge, as its magic recognizes a valiant effort.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
