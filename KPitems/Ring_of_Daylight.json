      "value": "<p><em>Ring, Rare (Requires Attunement)</em><br>This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. By speaking the command word, you can make the ring shed light in a 60-foot-radius sphere for 1 hour. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet. If you close your fist, put on a glove, or otherwise cover your ring hand completely, you block the light. If any of this lightâ€™s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled.<br>In addition, melee or ranged attacks you make while wearing the ring of daylight deal radiant damage rather than their normal type.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
