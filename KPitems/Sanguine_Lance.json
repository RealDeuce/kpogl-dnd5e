      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (lance), uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>This fiendish lance runs red with blood. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.<br>When you hit a creature that has blood with this lance, the target takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.<br><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> This lance is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Each day, as long as you remain cursed, you have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws until you draw blood from another creature with the lance. Once the lance has done damage to another creature or its surface has been in contact with the blood of another creature, this effect of the curse is suppressed until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
