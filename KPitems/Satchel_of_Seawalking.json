      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em><br>This eel-hide leather pouch is always filled with an unspeakably foul-tasting, coarse salt. You can use an action to toss a handful of the salt onto the surface of an unoccupied space of water. The water in a 5-foot cube becomes solid for 1 minute, resembling greenish-blue glass. This cube is buoyant and can support up to 750 pounds. When the duration expires, the hardened water cracks ominously and returns to a liquid state.<br>If you toss the salt into an occupied space, the water congeals briefly then disperses harmlessly. If the satchel is opened underwater, the pouch is destroyed as its contents permanently harden.<br>Once five handfuls of the salt have been pulled from the satchel, the satchel canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
