      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement by a Bard, Cleric, or Wizard)</em><br>When you speak the command word and turn the key while pointing it at foe wearing metallic armor, this item turns the armor molten. The wearer of any metallic armor that is targeted by the <em>Scarlet Key</em> must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the armor, if it’s nonmagical, melts and is destroyed, and the target takes 6d6 fire damage, but if the armor’s magical, the wearer still suffers the damage, and the armor is not destroyed but instead sapped of all magical properties until after the wearer takes a short or long rest (though it is still considered magical).<br>If combined with the <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressitems.Item.KPcrimsonscepter]{Crimson Scepter}</em>, the Scarlet Key unlocks an eternal blue flame that dances atop the scepter, which now regains all expended charges each day at dawn, instead of its usual 1d8 + 1.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
