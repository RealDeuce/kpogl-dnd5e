      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, common (requires attunement by a master of the kaunen rune)</em><br>This item is usually a flat disc of metal, stone, or wood with the kaunen rune inscribed upon it, and can be disguised as some commonplace item—a plate, tool, or even a coin—when created. When a <em>scorch bomb</em> is activated, the user chooses a time up to 6 hours in the future. At the appointed time, the item erupts in a 10-foot burst of flame. Any creatures caught in the blast take 10 (3d6) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. The explosion also ignites combustible material. The <em>scorch bomb</em> is not destroyed in the blast; it can be used again after it sits in a fire for 1 hour.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
