      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, common</em><br>This skull looks like a normal animal or humanoid skull. You can use an action to place the skull on the ground, a table, or other surface and activate it with a command word. The skull’s magic triggers when a creature comes within 5 feet of it without speaking that command word. The skull emits a green glow from its eye sockets, shedding dim light in a 15-foot radius, levitates up to 3 feet in the air, and emits a piercing scream for 1 minute that is audible up to 600 feet away. The skull can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.<br>The skull has AC 13 and 5 hit points. If destroyed while active, it releases a burst of necromantic energy. Each creature within 5 feet of the skull must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
