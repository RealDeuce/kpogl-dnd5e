      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (Greataxe), Fabled (5th-Level and Higher Properties Require Attunement)</em><br>Checkered patterns decorate this double-headed axe whose blades are carved like dragons—one grinning and the other grimacing.<br>Only warriors of incredible skill have a chance to survive multiple years of their profession, and luck plays no small part in ensuring a soldier lives to see their golden years. Champions with seemingly endless luck often sit at the heart of legend, enchanting audiences with tales of ever-riskier exploits and thrilling narrow escapes. Weapons in the hands of such warriors often take on a measure of their wielder’s luck, becoming precious tools to keep their masters fighting in the rare moments their luck runs out.<br>Whenever you must choose between two options (such as turning left or right) or engage in an activity where the odds are 50/50 (such as flipping a coin) while holding the axe, you get the most favorable possible outcome (as determined by the GM).<br><em><strong>Good Fortune (Requires Attunement).</strong></em> As your level increases, you gain the following benefits while wielding this weapon.<br><em><strong>5th level.</strong></em> You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this weapon. Additionally, when you miss on a melee attack made with <em>Second Chance</em>, you can spend your reaction to successfully hit instead. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you complete a short or long rest.<br><em><strong>9th level.</strong></em> If you would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage while the axe is within 30 feet of you, you instead drop to 1 hit point. Once this property has been used, it cannot be used again until the following dawn.<br><em><strong>13th level.</strong></em> You now gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this weapon instead of +1.
