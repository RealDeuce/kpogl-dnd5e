      "value": "<p><em>Armor (Shield), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)</em><br>The shield has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding this shield, you can expend 1 charge to create a beam of light 10 feet wide and 120 feet long to illuminate everything in front of the shield. All creatures in this beam of light appear in their true form: shapeshifters appear as their unshifted forms, illusions fail to disguise their users, and so on. You can maintain this beam for up to 1 minute, requiring concentration.<br>Additionally, undead in the beam take 1d6 radiant damage each round they remain in the beam.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
