The light lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word.<br>The ring has 6 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 charges daily at dawn.<br><em><strong>Bestow Shimmer.</strong></em> While wearing the ring, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to charge a weapon you wield with silvery energy until the start of your next turn.
