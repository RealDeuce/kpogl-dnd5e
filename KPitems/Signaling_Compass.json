      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon</em><br>The exterior of this clamshell metal case features a polished, mirror-like surface on one side and an ornate filigree on the other. Inside is a magnetic compass. While the case is closed, you can use an action to speak the command word and project a harmless beam of light up to 1 mile.<br>As an action while holding the compass, you can flash a concentrated beam of light at a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The compass canâ€™t be used this way again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
