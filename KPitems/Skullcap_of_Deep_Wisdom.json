      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>This scholarâ€™s cap is covered in bright stitched runes, and the interior is rough, like bark or sharkskin. This cap has 9 charges. It regains 1d8 + 1 expended charges daily at midnight. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells, using your spell save DC or save DC 15, whichever is higher: <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressspells.Item.KPdestructiveres]{destructive resonance}</em> (2 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressspells.Item.KPnetherweapon00]{nether weapon}</em> (4 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressspells.Item.KPprotectionfrom]{protection from the void}</em> (1 charge), or <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressspells.Item.KPvoidstrike0000]{void strike}</em> (3 charges).<br><em><strong>Dangers of the Void.</strong></em> The first time you cast a spell from the cap each day, your eyes shine with a sickly green light until you finish a long rest. If you spend at least 3 charges from the cap, a trickle of blood also seeps from beneath the cap until you finish a long rest. In addition, each time you cast a spell from the cap, you must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or your Intelligence is reduced by 2 until you finish a long rest. This DC increases by 1 for each charge you spent to cast the spell.<br><em><strong>Void Calls to Void.</strong></em> When you cast a spell from the cap while within 1 mile of a creature that understands Void Speech, the creature immediately knows your name, location, and general appearance.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
