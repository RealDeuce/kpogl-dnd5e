      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)</em><br>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The blade of the sword is coated in an endless supply of violet-colored slime. Despite the sword’s tendency to drip, the slime does not flow over the pommel, regardless of the angle at which it is held. You are immune to the effect of the slime while attuned to this sword. While holding this sword, you can communicate telepathically with ooze creatures, and you have advantage on Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against ooze creatures.<br>In addition, you can use an action to fling some of the sword’s slime at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 2d4 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned. The sword can’t be used this way again until 1 hour has passed.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
