      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (spear), very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This spear has an ivory haft, and tiny snowflakes occasionally fall from its tip. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this magic spear, the target takes an extra 1d6 cold damage.<br>You can use an action to transform the spear into a pair of snow skis. While wearing the snow skis, you have a walking speed of 40 feet when you walk across snow or ice, and you can walk across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. You can use a bonus action to transform the skis back into the spear. While the spear is transformed into a pair of skis, you canâ€™t make attacks with it.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
