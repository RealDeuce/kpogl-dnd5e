      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (spear), very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This rowan wood spear has a thick knot in the center of the haft that uncannily resembles a petrified human heart. When you hit with an attack using this magic spear, the target takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage.<br>The spear has 3 charges, and it regains all expended charges daily at dusk. When you hit a creature with an attack using it, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 3d6 necrotic damage to the target. You regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.<br><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> This spear is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you until you are targeted by the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.XZhdgVK3cLoxNCQl]{remove curse}</em> spell or similar magic. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the spear, keeping it within reach at all times. When you expend a charge from the spear, you must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become sensitive to bright light and distracted by a thirst for blood for 1d4 hours. If you are already suffering from this effect when you fail the saving throw, increase the duration by 1d4 hours. For the duration, you have disadvantage on Wisdom and Intelligence checks.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
