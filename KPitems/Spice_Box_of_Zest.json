      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, very rare</em><br>This small, square wooden box is carved with scenes of life in a busy city. Inside, the box is divided into six compartments, each holding a different magical spice. A small wooden spoon is also stored inside the box for measuring. A spice box of zest contains six spoonfuls of each spice when full.<br>You can add one spoonful of a single spice per person to a meal that you or someone else is cooking. The magic of the spices is nullified if you add two or more spices together.<br>If a creature consumes a meal cooked with a spice, it gains a benefit based on the spice used in the meal. The effects last for 1 hour unless otherwise noted.<br><em><strong>Baharat.</strong></em> The feasterâ€™s Strength score increases to 21.<br><em><strong>Cassia.</strong></em> The feaster is cured of all levels of exhaustion.<br><em><strong>Cloves.</strong></em> The feaster has immunity to the frightened condition.<br><em><strong>Fiery Chilies.</strong></em> The feaster can use a bonus action to exhale fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The effect ends after the feaster exhales fire or after 1 hour, whichever comes first.<br><em><strong>Saffron.</strong></em> The feaster becomes charmed by the next creature it sees within 10 minutes of consuming the meal. If the creature it sees is of a species and gender the feaster normally finds attractive, the feaster regards the creature it sees as its true love while charmed in this way.<br><em><strong>Turmeric.</strong></em> The feaster has advantage on saving throws against spells.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
