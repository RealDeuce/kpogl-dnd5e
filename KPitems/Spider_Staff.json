      "value": "<p><em>Staff, rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)</em><br>Delicate web-like designs are carved into the wood of this twisted staff, which is often topped with the carved likeness of a spider. The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.S0zDrv6lbnwWaz9E]{swarm of spiders} appears and consumes the staff then vanishes.<br><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: giant insect (4 charges), spider climb (2 charges), or web (2 charges).<br><em><strong>Spider Swarm.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.S0zDrv6lbnwWaz9E]{swarm of spiders} to appear in a space that you can see within 60 feet of you. The swarm is friendly to you and your companions but otherwise acts on its own. The @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.S0zDrv6lbnwWaz9E]{swarm of spiders} remains for 1 minute, until you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 100 feet away from it.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
