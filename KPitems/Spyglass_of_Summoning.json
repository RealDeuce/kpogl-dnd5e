      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>Arcane runes encircle this polished brass spyglass. You can view creatures and objects as far as 600 feet away through the spyglass, and they are magnified to twice their size. You can magnify your view of a creature or object to up to four times its size by twisting the end of the spyglass.<br><em><strong>Summoning.</strong></em> While looking through the spyglass, you can use an action to teleport one Large or smaller creature or object you can see through the spyglass to an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw is unaffected. If the object is being worn or carried, the creature wearing or carrying it must succeed on the saving throw to prevent the object from being teleported. Once used, this property of the spyglass canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
