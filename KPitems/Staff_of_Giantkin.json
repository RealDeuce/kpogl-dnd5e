      "value": "<p><em>Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, or wizard)</em><br>This stout, oaken staff is 7 feet long, bound in iron, and topped with a carving of a broad, thick-fingered hand. While holding this magic quarterstaff, your Strength score is 20. This has no effect on you if your Strength is already 20 or higher. The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the hand slowly clenches into a fist, and the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.<br><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.9eOZDBImVKxbeOyZ]{enhance ability}</em> (bear’s endurance or bull’s strength only, 2 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WahI41a3goVUg0x1]{enlarge/reduce}</em> (enlarge only, 2 charges), or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.B0pnIcc52O6G8hi8]{longstrider}</em> (1 charge).<br><em><strong>Throw Boulder.</strong></em> You can use an action to expend up to 3 of the staff ’s charges to force the staff 's hand to grasp an object within 5 feet of you that is no larger than a Small boulder and hurl it at a point you can see within 100 feet of you. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw, using your spell save DC. For each charge you expend, a creature takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
