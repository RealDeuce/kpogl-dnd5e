      "value": "<p><em>Staff, legendary (requires attunement by a fighter or monk)</em><br>This plain-looking, wooden staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.<br>The staff has 12 charges and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, loses all other properties, and the next time you roll a 20 on an attack roll using the staff, it explodes, dealing an extra 6d6 force damage to the target then is destroyed. On a 20, the staff regains 1d10 + 2 charges.<br>Some of the staff ’s properties require the target to make a saving throw to resist or lessen the property’s effects. The saving throw DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.<br><em><strong>Bamboo in the Rainy Season.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 charge to grant the staff the reach property until the start of your next turn.<br><em><strong>Gate to the Hell of Being Roasted Alive.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.7u2obDvuvtZBkTfq]{scorching ray}</em> spell from it. When you make the spell’s attacks, you use your Wisdom modifier as your spellcasting ability.<br><em><strong>Iron Whirlwind.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you use an action to expend 2 charges, causing weighted chains to extend from the end of the staff and reducing your speed to 0 until the end of your next turn. As part of the same action, you can make one attack with the staff against each creature within your reach. If you roll a 1 on any attack, you must immediately make an attack roll against yourself as well before resolving any other attacks against opponents.<br><em><strong>Monkey Steals the Peach.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 charge to extend sharp, grabbing prongs from the end of the staff. Until the start of your next turn, each time you hit a creature with the staff, the target takes piercing damage instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for the staff, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target is incapacitated until the end of its next turn as it suffers crippling pain. On a success, the target has disadvantage on its next attack roll.<br><em><strong>Rebuke the Disobedient Child.</strong></em> When you are hit by a creature you can see within your reach while holding this staff, you can use a reaction to expend 1 charge to make an attack with the staff against the attacker.<br><em><strong>Seven Vengeful Demons Death Strike.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 7 charges and make one attack against a target within 5 feet of you with the staff. If the attack hits, the target takes bludgeoning damage as normal, and it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 7d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target dies from this damage, the staff ceases to function as anything other than a magic quarterstaff until the next dawn, but it regains all expended charges when its powers return. A humanoid killed by this damage rises at the start of your next turn as a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.NAISFPoNNgUCsEyW]{zombie} that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.<br><em><strong>Swamp Hag's Deadly Breath.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 2 charges to expel a 15-foot cone of poisonous gas out of the end of the staff. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 4d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 hour. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned.<br><em><strong>Vaulting Leap of the Clouds.</strong></em> If you are holding the staff and it has at least 1 charge, you can cast the jump spell from it as a bonus action at will without using any charges, but you can target only yourself when you do so.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
