      "value": "<p><em>Wand, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)</em><br>This staff has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the staffâ€™s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles to ash and is destroyed.<br><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.pxpb2eOB6bv4phAf]{banishment}</em> (5 charges) or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.15Fa6q1nH27XfbR8]{dispel magic}</em> (2 charges).<br><em><strong>Unravel Matter.</strong></em> With this staff, you can disintegrate any non-magical object weighing less than 1 pound by expending a charge and speaking the command word.<br><em><strong>Unravel Creature.</strong></em> By expending 2 charges and speaking the command word, you can choose a creature that you can see within 30 feet. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature that fails the saving throw must use its action each turn to repeat the saving throw as it attempts to keep itself in one piece. On a successful save, the effect ends on the target. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
