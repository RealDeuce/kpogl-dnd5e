      "value": "<p><em>Staff, legendary (requires attunement)</em><br>This twisted, black staff appears to be made of obsidian. You can wield the staff as a quarterstaff, gaining a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls. The staff has 10 charges and regains 2d4 + 2 charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff dissolves into a cloud of corrosive, maddening vapors, dealing 10 (3d6) necrotic and 7 (3d6) psychic damage to all creatures within 5 feet. You may expend 1 or more of these charges to use the following properties:<ul><li>Ebon Grasp. You can expend 1 charge when attacking with the staff. On a successful hit, the staff becomes a writhing tentacle that grapples your opponent (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and you cannot attack with the staff. You can use the Touch of the Void property on a grappled opponent, automatically dealing damage by expending a charge. You can end the grapple as a bonus action on your turn. If a creature dies while grappled, the staff regains 1 charge.</li><li>Spellcasting. You can use the staff to cast the following spells: <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressspells.Item.KPmaddeningwhisp]{maddening whispers}</em> (2 charges) and <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressspells.Item.KPconjureminorvo]{conjure minor voidborn}</em> (5 charges).</li><li>Touch of the Void. You can use an Attack action to touch an opponent, expending 1 charge. On a successful hit, the target takes 7 (2d6) cold damage and 7 (2d6) psychic damage.</li><li>Void-Touched. Creatures other than satarre that attune themselves to the staff must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or suffer void taint.</li><br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
