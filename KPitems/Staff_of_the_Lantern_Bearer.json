      "value": "<p><em>Staff, uncommon</em><br>An iron hook is affixed to the top of this plain, wooden staff. While holding this staff, you can use an action to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.Bnn9Nzajixvow9xi]{light}</em> spell from it at will, but the light can emanate only from the staff ’s hook. If a lantern hangs from the staff ’s hook, you gain the following benefits while holding the staff:<ul><li>You can control the light of the lantern, lighting or extinguishing it as a bonus action. The lantern must still have oil, if it requires oil to produce a flame.</li><li>The lantern’s flame can’t be extinguished by wind or water.</li><li>If you are a spellcaster, you can use the staff as a spellcasting focus. When you cast a spell that deals fire or radiant damage while using this staff as your spellcasting focus, you gain a +1 bonus to the spell’s attack roll, or the spell’s save DC increases by 1 (your choice).</li><br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
