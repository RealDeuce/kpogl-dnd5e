      "value": "<p><em>Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a wizard)</em><br>Crafted by a skilled wizard and meant to be a spellcaster’s last defense, this staff is 5 feet long, made of yew wood that curves at its top, is iron shod at its mid-section, and capped with a silver dragon’s claw that holds a lustrous, though rough and uneven, black pearl.<br>This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 to attack and damage rolls made with it. It has 4 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. Once daily, it can regain 1 expended charge by exposing the pearl to direct moonlight for 1 turn.<br>When used as a weapon, the staff howls and whistles hauntingly like the wind. When its spells are employed, the staff chirps like insects on a hot summer night.<br><strong>Spells.</strong> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.nqBDWkVOfcGZt4YU]{faerie fire}</em> (3 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.FSMy6VAjDnXY9vWz]{gust of wind}</em> (1 charge).<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
