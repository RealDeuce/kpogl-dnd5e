      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>These impractically spiked gauntlets are made from adamantine, are charged with raw elemental earth magic, and limit the range of motion in your fingers. While wearing these gauntlets, you can’t carry a weapon or object, and you can’t climb or otherwise perform precise actions requiring the use of your hands. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike while wearing these gauntlets, the unarmed strike deals an extra 1d4 piercing damage.<br><em><strong>Stone Burrow.</strong></em> You can use an action to speak the command word to gain a burrowing speed of 10 feet for 10 minutes. You can burrow through earth and stone, leaving a tunnel in your wake large enough for a Medium creature to pass through (Large creatures have their speed halved from stooping). The tunnel collapses when you lose the burrowing speed. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
