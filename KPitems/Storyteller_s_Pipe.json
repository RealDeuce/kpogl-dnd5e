      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This long-shanked wooden smoking pipe is etched with leaves along the bowl. Although it is serviceable as a typical pipe, you can use an action to blow out smoke and shape the smoke into wispy images for 10 minutes. This effect works like the silent image spell, except its range is limited to a 10-foot cone in front of you, and the images can be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The smoky images last for 3 rounds before fading, but you can continue blowing smoke to create more images for the duration or until the pipe burns through the smoking material in it, whichever happens first.<br><em><strong>Choking Smoke.</strong></em> You can use an action to speak the pipe’s command word then blow on the pipe, which emits choking smoke in a 30-foot cone. The smoke spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the smoke, otherwise it lasts for 1 minute. Each creature that enters the smoke or that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be unable to breathe or speak as it coughs uncontrollably for 1 minute. A creature affected in this way can’t cast spells with verbal components. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature spends 3 rounds coughing from the smoke, it suffers one level of exhaustion. A creature can’t suffer more than one level of exhaustion from exposure to this smoke. Once used, this property can’t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
