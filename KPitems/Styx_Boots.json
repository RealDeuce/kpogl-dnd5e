      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>These boots are usually made of heavy, sturdy leather—perhaps it’s demon hide or some other planar creature’s hide. While wearing these boots, you can walk over any body of water as if it were normal terrain, and you can slide or skate over relatively calm waters, snow, ice, sand, magma, or other smooth surfaces at double your normal walking speed. If the snow or ice is on a hill, you move at triple your normal walking speed. You can still use the Dash action normally as well.<br>When combined with the <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressitems.Item.KParmoroftheblac]{armor of the Black River}</em>, the <em>Styx boots</em> permit you to use any branch of the River Styx and other planar waterways as a form of shadow road. Once per week, you can walk on such a planar waterway for 8 hours and arrive at any other plane of your choosing.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
