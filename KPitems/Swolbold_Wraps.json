      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>When wearing these cloth wraps, your forearms and hands swell to half again their normal size without negatively impacting your fine motor skills. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with unarmed strikes while wearing these wraps. In addition, your unarmed strike uses a d4 for damage and counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.<br>When you hit a target with an unarmed strike and the target is no more than one size larger than you, you can use a bonus action to automatically grapple the target. Once this special bonus action has been used three times, it canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
