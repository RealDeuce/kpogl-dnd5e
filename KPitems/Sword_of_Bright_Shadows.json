      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (longsword), legendary (requires attunement)</em><br>This beautiful steel longsword was forged long ago by the Holly King, an ancient elf-lord of the forest. The blade is made in an archaic elven style, with a three-pronged hilt and heavy use of mithral in the alloy. The weapon gives off bright light in a 20-ft. radius and dim light for an additional 20 ft. when drawn from its black wyvern-hide scabbard.<br>The <em>Sword of Bright Shadows</em> is magic weapon with a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. When you hit a creature from the Shadow Realm or who bears the taint of shadow, you deal an additional 5 (1d10) radiant damage to the target. The wielder of the sword never casts a shadow, though in dark conditions he casts a reverse shadow—a dimly glowing patch of ground that shows his form. This property gives the sword its name, but it also effectively negates invisibility for the sword’s bearer in twilight or dark conditions. The bearer always has disadvantage on Stealth attempts that rely on remaining out of sight.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
