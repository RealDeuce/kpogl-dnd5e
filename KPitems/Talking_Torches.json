      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>These heavy iron and wood torches are typically found in pairs or sets of four. While holding this torch, you can use an action to speak a command word and cause it to produce a magical, heatless flame that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. You can use a bonus action to repeat the command word to extinguish the light. If more than one <em>talking torch</em> remain lit and touching for 1 minute, they become magically bound to each other. A torch remains bound until the torch is destroyed or until it is bound to another <em>talking torch</em> or set of talking torches.<br>While holding or carrying the torch, you can communicate telepathically with any creature holding or carrying one of the torches bound to your torch, as long as both torches are lit and within 5 miles of each other.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
