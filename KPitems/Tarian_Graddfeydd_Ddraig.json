      "value": "<p><em>Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This metal shield has an outer coating consisting of hardened resinous insectoid secretions embedded with flakes from ground dragon scales collected from various dragon wyrmlings and one dragon that was killed by shadow magic. While holding this shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC. In addition, you have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, and poison damage dealt by the breath weapons of dragons.<br>While wielding the shield in an area of dim or bright light, you can use an action to reflect the light off the shield’s dragon scale flakes to cause a cone of multicolored light to flash from it (15-foot cone if in dim light; 30-foot cone if in bright light). Each creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d6 and consult the following table to determine which color is reflected at it. The shield can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.<table><tr><th>d6</th><th>Effect</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Red.</strong> The target takes 6d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td><strong>White.</strong> The target takes 4d6 cold damage and is restrained until the start of your next turn on a failed save, or half as much damage and is not restrained on a successful one.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td><strong>Blue.</strong> The target takes 4d6 lightning damage and is paralyzed until the start of your next turn on a failed save, or half as much damage and is not paralyzed on a successful one.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td><strong>Black.</strong> The target takes 4d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target failed the save, it also takes an extra 2d6 acid damage on the start of your next turn.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td><strong>Green.</strong> The target takes 4d6 poison damage and is poisoned until the start of your next turn on a failed save, or half as much damage and is not poisoned on a successful one.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td><strong>Shadow.</strong> The target takes 4d6 necrotic damage and its Strength score is reduced by 1d4 on a failed save, or half as much damage and does not reduce its Strength score on a successful one. The target dies if this Strength reduction reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.</td></tr></table><br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
