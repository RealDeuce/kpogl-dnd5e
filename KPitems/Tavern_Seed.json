      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Uncommon</em><br>A <em>tavern seed</em> must be used outdoors, and when thrown, it creates a small, snug tavern of stone and wood, roughly 40 feet by 20 feet, with a lower public floor and an upper floor devoted to the staff bedchambers, storage, and a single room for rent. The entire building takes on an outward style of architecture, materials, roofing, and appearance as suits the region where it stands. It has a staff of three: a cook, a bartender, and a servant, of a type typical of the region (so humans in a human realm, shadow fey in the Shadow Realm, goblins in the wastelands, and so on).<br>Using a tavern seed in an existing settlement creates a snug tavern as normal, magically shifting two buildings to either side slightly to make room. The new structure is certainly notable and surprising to residents of the place.<br>A <em>tavern seed</em> combined with a <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressitems.Item.KProadseed000000]{road seed}</em> always includes a set of warm, secure stables as well as the tavern building itself.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
