      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies by Color</em><br>This tear-shaped gemstone is roughly the size of an adult human’s palm. Though cold to the touch, it hums with mystical vitality, and fleeting images can be glimpsed along its surface. You may spend a short rest meditating on the images within, and during your meditation, you experience a memory held within the gem, as determined by the GM. When you complete the meditation, you gain a proficiency that lasts until you complete a long rest (as detailed in the Tears of the Dreamer table). Only one creature can gain the benefit of a particular gem at a time, and once a gem has granted its benefit, it cannot do so again until the next dawn.<br>Additionally, the gem can be ground into a fine dust that can be used in place of the spell components of equivalent monetary value. Doing so destroys the gem. The worth of the gem dust is noted in the chart below. If the spell consumes the spell components, it instead consumes the equivalent value of dust.<table><tr><th>d100</th><th>Gem Color</th><th>Rarity</th><th>Proficiency</th><th>Value</th></tr><tr><td>1–20</td><td>Blue</td><td>Rare</td><td>Perception or Investigation (User’s Choice)</td><td>5,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>21–40</td><td>Green</td><td>Rare</td><td>Insight or Deception (User’s Choice)</td><td>5,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>41–60</td><td>White</td><td>Rare</td><td>Medicine or Nature (User’s Choice)</td><td>5,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>61–69</td><td>Yellow</td><td>Very Rare</td><td>Sleight of Hand, Acrobatics, or forgery kit</td><td>10,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>70–78</td><td>Orange</td><td>Very Rare</td><td>Alchemist’s tools, Arcana, martial ranged weapons</td><td>10,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>79–87</td><td>Red</td><td>Very Rare</td><td>Thieves’ tools, Stealth, medium armor</td><td>10,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>88–96</td><td>Purple</td><td>Very Rare</td><td>Navigator’s tools, Survival, martial melee weapons</td><td>10,000 gp</td></tr><tr><td>97–100</td><td>Black</td><td>Legendary</td><td>Any three skill, equipment, or tool proficiencies (User’s Choice)</td><td>50,000 gp</td></tr></table><br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
