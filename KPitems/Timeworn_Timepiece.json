      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This tarnished silver pocket watch seems to be temporally displaced and allows for limited manipulation of time.<br>The timepiece has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at midnight. While holding the timepiece, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge after you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw to force the creature to reroll. You make this decision after you see whether the roll succeeds or fails. The target must use the result of the second roll.<br>Alternatively, you can expend 2 charges as a reaction at the start of another creature's turn to swap places in the Initiative order with that creature. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw is unaffected.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
