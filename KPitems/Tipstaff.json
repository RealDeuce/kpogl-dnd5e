      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (club), rare (requires attunement)</em><br>To the uninitiated, this short ebony baton resembles a heavy-duty truncheon with a cord-wrapped handle and silver-capped tip. The weapon has 5 charges, and it regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.<br>When you hit a creature with a melee attack with this magic weapon, you can expend 1 charge to force the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the creature took 20 damage or more from this attack, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><em><strong>Warrant.</strong></em> You can use an action to slip an officially issued warrant under the cords of the grip of this weapon. While it has a warrant in it, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 bludgeoning damage when you hit the creature listed in the warrant with this weapon. The tipstaff can have only one warrant in it at a time, and the warrant can name no more than three creatures.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
