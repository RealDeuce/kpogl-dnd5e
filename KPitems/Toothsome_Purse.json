      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>This common-looking leather pouch holds a nasty surprise for pickpockets. If a creature other than you reaches into the purse, small, sharp teeth emerge from the mouth of the bag. The bag makes a melee attack roll against that creature with a +3 bonus. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 piercing damage. If the bag rolls a 20 on the attack roll, the would-be pickpocket has disadvantage on any Dexterity checks made with that hand until the damage is healed.<br>If the purse is lifted entirely from you, the purse continues to bite at the thief each round until it is dropped or until it is placed where it can’t reach its target. It bites at any creature, other than you, who attempts to pick it up, unless that creature genuinely desires to return the purse and its contents to you.<br>The purse attacks only if it is attuned to a creature. A purse that isn’t attuned to a creature lies dormant and doesn’t attack.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
