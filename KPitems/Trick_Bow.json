      "value": "<p><em><strong>Availability:</strong> Uncommon shortbow, 50 gp</em><br>Made from the light yet strong wood of the pruzny tree, this decorated shortbow is used in archery competitions and hunting small game. The heavier upper limb of the bow is often carved to depict the archer’s family symbol or an icon that is meaningful to the archer. The range on these weapons is half that of a normal shortbow as they are not designed for the rigors of combat. They provide advantage on Charisma (Performance) checks when used by skilled archers. Legends tell of a lost bow carved to depict Grandmother Yaga; the bow is said to be haunted by the crone’s magic—firing snakes instead of arrows.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
