      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (trident), very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>This bronze trident has a shaft of inlaid blue pearl. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this magic weapon.<br><em><strong>Whirlpool.</strong></em> While wielding the trident underwater, you can use an action to speak its command word and cause the water around you to whip into a whirlpool for 1 minute. For the duration, each creature that enters or starts its turn in a space within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the whirlpool. The whirlpool moves with you, and creatures restrained by it move with it. A creature within 5 feet of the whirlpool can pull a creature out of it by taking an action to make a DC 15 Strength check and succeeding. A restrained creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the whirlpool. Once used, this property canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
