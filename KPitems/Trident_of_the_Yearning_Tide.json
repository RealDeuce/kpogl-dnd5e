      "value": "<p><em>Weapon (trident), very rare (requires attunement)</em><br>The barbs of this trident are forged from mother‑of‑pearl and its shaft is fashioned from driftwood. You gain a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding the trident, you can breathe underwater.<br>The trident has 3 charges for the following other properties. It regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.<br><em><strong>Call Sealife.</strong></em> While holding the trident, you can use an action to expend 3 of its charges to cast the conjure animals spell from it. The creatures you summon must be beasts that can breathe water.<br><em><strong>Yearn for the Tide.</strong></em> When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the trident, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 charge to force the target to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target must spend its next turn leaping into the nearest body of water and swimming toward the bottom. A creature that can breathe underwater automatically succeeds on the saving throw. If no water is in the target’s line of sight, the target automatically succeeds on the saving throw.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
