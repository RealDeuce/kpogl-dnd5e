      "value": "<p><em>Armor (Light, Medium, Or Heavy), Rare</em><br>This armor is a dull gray, marked with flecks of gold or silver and sometimes filigreed in luminous purple swirls. While wearing this armor, you emit a trail of shadows that obscures your passage, wiping away tracks and hiding your movement. All attempts to track you are made with disadvantage, and all ranged attacks against you are also made with disadvantage. However, bright light (such as from sunlight or the <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.BP3GCwa66IAw1yTG]{daylight}</em> spell) negates both effects and makes this armor easy to see. In these conditions, all attacks made against you gain a +2 to the attack roll.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
