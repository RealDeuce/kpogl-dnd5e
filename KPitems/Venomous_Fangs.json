      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)</em><br>These prosthetic fangs can be positioned over your existing teeth or in place of missing teeth. While wearing these fangs, your bite is a natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic bite.<br>While you wear the fangs, a successful DC 9 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks conceals them from view. At the GM’s discretion, you have disadvantage on Charisma (Deception) or Charisma (Persuasion) checks against creatures that notice the fangs.<br><em><strong>Poisoned Bite.</strong></em> You can use an action to cause the fangs to fill with a green poison. The poison remains active for 1 minute or until an attack using these fangs hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of its next turn. The fangs can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
