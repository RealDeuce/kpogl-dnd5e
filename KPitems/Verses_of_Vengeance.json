      "value": "<p><em>Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)</em><br>This massive, holy tome is bound in brass with a handle on the back cover. A steel chain dangles from the sturdy metal cover, allowing you to hang the tome from your belt or hook it to your armor. A locked clasp holds the tome closed, securing its contents.<br>You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wield this tome as a shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC. Alternatively, you can make melee weapon attacks with the tome as if it was a club. If you make an attack using use the tome as a weapon, you lose the shield’s bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn.<br><em><strong>Verse of Vengeance.</strong></em> As a reaction when a creature hits you with a melee attack or when you hit a creature with the tome, you can shout a verse of vengeance, and the target takes 1d4 radiant damage. Such verses include, “Surrender and know divine mercy!”, “Repent! The hour of judgment is upon you!”, “Confess and be purged from your unrighteousness!”, or similar verse appropriate to your deity.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
