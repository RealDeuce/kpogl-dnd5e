      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item, rare</em><br>This small jug weighs 5 pounds and has a ceramic snake coiled around it. You can use an action to speak a command word to cause the vessel to produce poison, which pours from the snake’s mouth. A poison created by the vessel must be used within 1 hour or it becomes inert.<br>The word “blade” causes the snake to produce 1 dose of serpent venom, enough to coat a single weapon.<br>The word “consume” causes the snake to produce 1 dose of assassin’s blood, an ingested poison.<br>The word “spit” causes the snake to spray a stream of poison at a creature you can see within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 2d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned.<br>Once used, the vessel can’t be used to create poison again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
