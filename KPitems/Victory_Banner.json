When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with a weapon, you can expend 1 charge to move up to your speed without provoking opportunity attacks.<br>You must be within 5 feet of the banner to expend any of its charges.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
