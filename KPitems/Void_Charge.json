      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous Item, Rare</em><br>This small, fist-sized orb is made of a glossy black substance and features three red runes arrayed in a circle. The void speech runes represent one, two, or three rounds.<br>As an action, you can touch one rune (choosing 1, 2, or 3 rounds) and then throw the void charge up to 60 feet. The orb vanishes on impact, transitioning momentarily to somewhere in the void, before reappearing in the same spot a number of rounds later equal to the rune you selected. The void charge reappears at the beginning of the round, detonates, and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of the explosion must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, creatures take 10 (4d4) cold damage and 10 (4d4) force damage. Creatures that succeed take half as much damage.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
