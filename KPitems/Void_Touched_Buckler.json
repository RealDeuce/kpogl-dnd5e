It sat for decades next to a small tear in the fabric of reality, which led to the outer planes. It has since become tainted by the Void.<br>While wielding this shield, you have a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.<br><em><strong>Invoke the Void.</strong></em> While wielding this shield, you can use an action to invoke the shield’s latent Void energy for 1 minute, causing a dark, swirling aura to envelop the shield. For the duration, when a creature misses you with a weapon attack, it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of its next turn. In addition, when a creature hits you with a weapon attack, it has advantage on weapon attack rolls against you until the end of its next turn. You can’t use this property of the shield again until the next dawn.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
