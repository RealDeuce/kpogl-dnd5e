      "value": "<p><em>Wand, very rare</em><br>This wand appears to be carved from the bones of a large fish, which have been cemented together. The wand has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.<br>While holding this wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to cause a thin stream of seawater to spray toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target can breathe only air, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or its lungs fill with rancid seawater and it begins drowning. A drowning creature chokes for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its turn after its choking ends, the creature drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check removes the seawater from the drowning creature’s lungs, ending the effect.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
