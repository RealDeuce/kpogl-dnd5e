      "value": "<p><em>Wand, uncommon</em><br>Fashioned out of oak, this wand appears heavily stained by an unknown liquid. The wand has 7 charges and regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand explodes in a puff of black smoke and is destroyed.<br>While holding the wand, you can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges to transform nonmagical liquid, such as blood, apple juice, or water, into an alcoholic beverage. For each charge you expend, you transform up to 1 gallon of nonmagical liquid into an equal amount of beer, wine, or other spirit. The alcohol transforms back into its original form if it hasnâ€™t been consumed within 24 hours of being transformed.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
