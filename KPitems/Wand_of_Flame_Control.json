      "value": "<p><em>Wand, common</em><br>This wand is fashioned from a branch of pine, stripped of bark and beaded with hardened resin. The wand has 3 charges. If you use the wand as an arcane focus while casting a spell that deals fire damage, you can expend 1 charge as part of casting the spell to increase the spell’s damage by 1d4.<br>In addition, while holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause one of the following effects:<ul><li>Change the color of any flames within 30 feet.</li><li>Cause a single flame to burn lower, halving the range of light it sheds but burning twice as long.</li><li>Cause a single flame to burn brighter, doubling the range of the light it sheds but halving its duration.</li><br>The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand bursts into flames and burns to ash in seconds.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
