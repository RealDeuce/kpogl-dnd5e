      "value": "<p><em>Wand, Rare</em><br>This narrow length of alder wood has a green gem on one end and a red gem on the other. This wand resembles a @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressitems.Item.KPwandofmimicdet]{wand of mimic detection} in every way, and its true nature can’t be discerned except by the use of an <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.3OZnNhunvRtPOQmH]{identify}</em> spell or higher magic. The wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cause one of the two following results:<ul><li>If the wand detects the presence of any monstrosity not in its true form within 30 feet of you, the red gem glows.</li><li>If the wand does not detect any monstrosity not in its true form within 30 feet of you, the green gem glows.</li><br>The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. The wand regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.<br><em><strong>Curse.</strong></em> This item is cursed. On its first use of the day, there is a 10% chance that instead of detecting a mimic, the wand’s red gem glows and turns an appropriately sized object within 30 feet into a mimic for 10 minutes. The wielder is unaware of the wand’s action. If a mimic was created, the curse remains viable for the entire day, and each subsequent use during the same day increases the curse chance by 10%.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
