      "value": "<p><em>Wand, Uncommon (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster)</em><br>This wand has 5 charges. While holding it, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks against creatures that rely on sight. You can also use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the <em>@UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressspells.Item.KPdarkbolt000000]{darkbolt}</em> spell (save DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 2nd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.<br>The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand turns to ash and is destroyed.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
