      "value": "<p><em><strong>Availability:</strong> Rare shield, 100 gp</em><br>The wagons of the wanderers are sturdily made, but the wheels offer a potential weak spot. The clever smiths and tinkerers have created removable shields that can be used to protect both wagon and warrior.<br>When four shields are affixed to a wagon, they increase the vehicle's durability (AC 15, 45 hp) and provide it with a damage threshold of 10. The wagon may only move one third its normal rate while the shields are in place.<br>You can remove a shield as an action and use it in combat, gaining an additional +1 to AC on top of the shield's normal bonus. Because it is heavy and awkward, you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks while wielding the shield if your Strength is less than 16.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
