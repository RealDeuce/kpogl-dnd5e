      "value": "<p><em>Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)</em><br>This staff is carved of ebony and wrapped in a net of silver wire. While holding it, you canâ€™t be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were difficult terrain. This staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, spidersilk surrounds the staff in a cocoon then quickly unravels itself and the staff, destroying the staff.<br><em><strong>Spells.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.DGONTFbk5eORs5qv]{black tentacles}</em> (the tentacles appear as large strands of gray webbing, 4 charges), <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.KJRVzeMQXPj8Gtyx]{spider climb}</em> (2 charges), or <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.UJJu9c2UvCzVljiP]{web}</em> (2 charges).<br><em><strong>Web Shot.</strong></em> While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to shoot a wad of webbing at a target you can see within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack, using your spellcasting ability. On a hit, the target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a Strength check against your spell save DC, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
