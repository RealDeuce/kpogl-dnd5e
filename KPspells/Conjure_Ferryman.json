      "value": "<p>When standing on a riverbank or on the shore of some other body of water, you summon a ferry spirit and its boat, which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The spirit disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The spirit is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It takes you and up to 1 companion per your level across the river or body of water (no action required by you) or to other locations along the same water. If you don’t issue any such commands, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.<br>If your concentration is broken, the ferry and its guide don’t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the conjured spirit, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled ferryman can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned it.<br>The GM has the ferry spirit’s statistics, using the statistics of a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.9ggQBmAKXraOtz7S]{bearded devil}.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the boat can take you and your companions across a planar boundary into the Ethereal Plane and then exit on another body of water. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, it can traverse the River Styx between planes, taking you and your companions to distant parts of the multiverse. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the ferryman uses the statistics of a @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.Actor.sLdpiuaZF8lujJQy]{barbed devil}.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
