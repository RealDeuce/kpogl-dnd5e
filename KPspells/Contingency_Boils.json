      "value": "<p>Choose a necromancy spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of 1 action, and has a range of Touch. You cast that spell-called the contingent spell-as part of casting contingency boils, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn’t come into effect. The contingent spell is stored in a boil on your skin that is created as part of the casting of contingency boils. Each time you cast contingency boils, you create a new boil on your skin. Your skin can contain a number of contingent spells within boils equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. For each boil on your skin, your Charisma score is reduced by 2 until you no longer have any boils from this spell on your skin.<br>When a creature within 5 feet of you deals damage to you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to rupture a boil. The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the rupture, targeting the attacker. That boil and that instance of the contingency boils spell then ends.<br>If you are affected by <em>@UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{lesser restoration}, @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.WzvJ7G3cqvIubsLk]{greater restoration}</em>, or a similar effect that removes diseases (such as a paladin’s Lay on Hands), all your boils are immediately cured and all instances of the spell end, removing all remaining boils and their stored spells.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
