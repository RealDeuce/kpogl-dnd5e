      "value": "<p>You reach out with your consciousness and step into the dreams of a creature you can see or a creature that is known to you. The creature must be on the same plane of existence as you and have a minimum Intelligence score of 7. If the target is not asleep or in meditation (in the case of elves or similar races) when the spell is cast, the spell fails. This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.<br>When you cast the spell, you enter your target’s dream, and you view the events as an invisible third party. The creature is unaware of your presence, and you cannot interact with the dream in any way other than the method listed below.<br>As an action, you can reach out your consciousness and attempt to influence the course of the dream. For example, you may cause something new to appear or cause the tone of the dream to change to a nightmare (or vice-versa) or influence a “character” in the dream other than the target to act a certain way. When you attempt to influence the dream, your target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, your attempt to alter the dream is successful. On a successful save, you are immediately ejected from the dream as the dreamer awakens.<br>For the duration of the spell, your body lies in repose in the location you cast the spell. You are blind and deaf to your body’s surroundings, though you can feel and are aware if you take damage. If your body is moved, the spell ends. If your target is awakened, the spell ends.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
