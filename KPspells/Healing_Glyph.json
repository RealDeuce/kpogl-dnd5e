      "value": "<p>When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or upon an object that can be carried (such as a book, a shield, a belt pouch, or a similar item). The glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 5 inches in diameter. If the glyph is not triggered before you finish a long rest, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends.<br>The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.<br>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the surface on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed on an object, the most common triggers include touching that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.<br>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the glyph could be set to affect Beasts or humans), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.<br>When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical restorative energy in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area that isn’t a Construct or Undead can choose one of the following effects:<ul><li><strong>Healing.</strong> The creature regains 3d8 hit points.</li><li><strong>Restoration.</strong> The creature is cured of one disease or one of the following conditions of its choice: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.</li><br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
