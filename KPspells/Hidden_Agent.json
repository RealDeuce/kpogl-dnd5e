      "value": "<p>You link your mind and consciousness with that of a creature you can see within range. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect.<br>For the duration, you can use an action to see, hear, smell, feel, and experience the world through the target’s senses, gaining the benefits of any special senses the target has, until you end the effect (no action required). During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. While sharing a target’s senses, it knows the languages you know if you choose for it to know them, and once each minute, you can influence one Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma check it makes. If the target was a willing creature, you can give it advantage on the check. If the target was an unwilling creature, you can give it disadvantage on the check.<br>Until the spell ends, you can communicate telepathically with the target, and you know the direction and approximate distance to the target, provided you are both on the same plane of existence. If the target was a willing creature, you can choose for the target to also know the direction and approximate distance to you.<br>An unwilling target can make another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each minute. It has disadvantage on the saving throw if it doesn’t know you are connected to it, such as if you haven’t spoken to the target telepathically and haven’t influenced its ability checks. On a success, the spell ends on the target. A willing target can end the spell as a bonus action. The spell ends early if you or the target are on a different plane of existence from each other, if the target is reduced to 0 hit points, or if the target is incapacitated.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 5th. Using a spell slot of 7th level or higher grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
