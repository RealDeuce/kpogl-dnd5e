      "value": "<p>With a word, you gesture across an area and cause the terrain to rise up into a 10-foot-tall hillock at a point you choose within range. You must be outdoors to cast this spell.The hillock is up to 30 feet long and up to 15 feet wide, and it must be in a line. If the hillock cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the hillock or to the top of the hillock (your choice).The ranged attack distance for a creature on top of the hillock is doubled, provided the target is at a lower elevation than the creature on the hillock. At the GM’s discretion, creatures on top of the hillock gain any additional bonuses or penalties that higher elevation might provide, such as advantage on attacks against those on lower elevations, being easier to spot, longer sight distance, or similar.<br>The steep sides of the hillock are difficult to climb. A creature at the bottom of the hillock that attempts to move up to the top must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC to climb to the top of the hillock.<br>This spell can’t manipulate stone construction, and rocks and structures shift to accommodate the hillock. If the hillock’s formation would make a structure unstable, the hillock fails to form in the structure’s spaces. Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant growth.The hillock carries any plants along with it.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell at 4th level or higher, you can increase the width of the hillock by 5 feet or the length by 10 feet for each slot above 3rd.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
