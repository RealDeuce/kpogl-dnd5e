      "value": "<p>You conjure up to four magical doorways in a surface you touch. The surface must be large enough to accommodate the doors, which are large enough for a Large or smaller creature to pass through. When you cast this spell, choose a nonmagical archway, doorway, or other threshold you have moved through at least once within 100 miles of you for each magical doorway you create. Each magical doorway opens onto the location of its associated nonmagical threshold for the duration. The spell ends early if the surface on which the magical doorways appear is destroyed.<br>When you cast this spell, you can choose a number of creatures equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. You and the chosen creatures are the only creatures able to use the magical doorways. The magical doorways are two-way for such creatures, allowing the creatures to pass between the two locations by moving through the doorways, opening the destination doors if necessary. All other creatures see the magical doorways as door-like outlines or silhouettes in a style of your choice on the surface you touched, and they see and can interact with the nonmagical thresholds at the destinations as if the locations werenâ€™t tied to magical doorways.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
