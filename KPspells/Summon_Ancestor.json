      "value": "<p>You speak the name of one of your ancestors (you need not be blood-related, but you must be considered part of their family line) while touching a stone as a focus for the spell. If you wish to bind the spirit (see below), you must also hold a personal object of theirs or something infused with their memories, like a journal, which is consumed at the end of the duration. The ancestor is summoned as a ghost with their memories and personality, except for memories of their death and the afterlife, which are suppressed.<br>You can attempt to summon an unknown ancestor, but the spell has a 30% chance of failure.<br>The ancestor will perform one of the following tasks for you when summoned:<ul><li><em><strong>Answer Five Questions.</strong></em> This functions as speak with dead, but as you are speaking to an intact soul, it can give more complete answers and can speculate if needed.</li><li><em><strong>Provide Advice.</strong></em> Your ancestor gives you information or guidance based on their skills and specialties in life. You gain advantage on all skill check rolls of a relevant skill until the next dawn.</li><br>Binding an ancestor ties them to the stone used as a focus for the spell, unable to move more than 120 feet away from it. You may choose to have your ancestor watch or guard the area.<br>If watching, the spirit hides in the Ethereal Plane and observes, appearing to you at the end of the duration to tell you what it saw.<br>If guarding, it attempts to scare off any creatures entering the area (or specific creatures you describe after casting the spell) but will only attack to defend itself.<br>You cannot summon the same ancestor more often than once in 10 days.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
