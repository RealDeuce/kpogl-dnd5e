      "value": "<p>You target a creature of your choice within range with a wasting of the flesh. Your target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 3d8 necrotic damage at the beginning of each of its turns for the duration. A target reduced to 0 hit points while under the effects of this spell has disadvantage on its death saving throws.<br>If your target dies, you can raise it as a zombie as a bonus action on your turn and can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to mentally command it as long as you are within 60 feet of it. If you command multiple undead as a result of multiple castings of this spell or similar spells like animate dead, you can command any or all of them at the same time using the same bonus action, issuing the same command to each one. You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.<br>The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command youâ€™ve given it. To maintain control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher before the current 24-hour period ends.<br><em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> If you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, your target takes 6d8 necrotic damage at the beginning of each of its turns and animates as a ghoul if it dies. If you cast it using a 9th-level spell slot, it takes 9d8 necrotic damage and animates as a ghast if it dies.<br>Content licensed under the @UUID[Compendium.koboldpressogl.koboldpressjournal.JournalEntry.KoboldPressOGL00.JournalEntryPage.KoboldPressOGLpg]{Open Game License}",
